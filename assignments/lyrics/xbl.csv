So you can excuse me, I'm too busy watching hoes poppin' they coochie
Oh yeah I can see why you call me Bruce Lee
My chinese connections got deals on QPs
The rookie of the year man, pullin' a flukey
I feel to do the right thing but I aint moving
A man of my action, go ahead and act
I'm passionate and rappin' with a west coast accent
My homies to the point when they speak to women
And we still conversatin' so we keep it pimpin
I been breaking rules all my life
Seventh grade in the back room chocolate type
I need paper, hey, up in a major way
I won't cater a play for those that hatin' the game
I say later don't look at this as doing me a favor
I made a pact with my home boys to keep it player
A gangster in a hotub in the midst of drama
The bullets hit the water, make it look just like a sauna
Some holla for Madonna, man
Some holla for they momma
9 times out of 10 they know knew who shot 'em
A gangster in a hotub in the midst of drama
The bullets hit the water, make it look just like a sauna
Some holla for Madonna, man
Some holla for they momma
9 times out of 10 they never knew who shot 'em
Yo this is the take off, and yo baby this is the bake off
Sirloin beef with the A1 steak sauce
I got it going on acting like a love jones
Turn like a cyclone, bust with the lights on
I hit the scene like Peppy La pui
I'm in a double vested suit that I copped from Lou
I'm from the X generation, crime location
Turn down your invitation to your radio station
Move like a cobra gone from the rollas
It's just like the hunt for the red October
Some pit-bull terror from the Ronald Regan era
And me and my players keep it cold as the Sierra
We dress like it's DQ magazine and the homies said he gotta keep a magazine
And this freak said she see me in a magazine
So we broke down jaw on the magazine
My shook a heel and under veils with 4 wheels
And driving with my knees so the weed don't spill
I'm going at you gator on your izod sweater
And broke cats say there aint nothing like cheddar
They bomb first and say I'm caught up in the wrong curse
And I never get to kick it with the god flirt
And when I ask why, they bust a alibi
They took my wings so an angel like me couldn't fly
And I wonder why
A gangster in a hotub in the midst of drama
The bullets hit the water, make it look just like a sauna
Some holla for Madonna, man
Some holla for they momma
9 times out of 10 they know knew who shot 'em
A gangster in a hotub in the midst of drama
The bullets hit the water, make it look just like a sauna
Some holla for Madonna, man
Some holla for they momma
9 times out of 10 they never knew who shot 'em"

My morning starts off with the chicken and the waffles
Baby say she never touched the hand of a capo
Shoot at the reflection in the mirror of life
If you hit your target then they say you live twice
In a box of lucky charms man keep a few Gs
And never talk about the tricks kept up your sleeve
Help you? please, I'm all about greed
Make the crowd freeze, get the cheese then leave
(Queezy)
Young Queez strike a pose like a statue
Brand new clothes, too close as I'm at you
Bad news bear, all you squares too late now
The Godfather said it best pay style
Not a little bit, not even fifty cent
We don't trip one dime in the city, pimp
West coast, the blade on the esco
And I leave her automatic at my next show

Pinky ring shinin like a baseball diamond
I was right there when that gangsta started cryin
Twisted and wired, gun-mouth 4 hire
The game that we it accept all liars
Fears and desires, no court room choirs
Forget about ""I quit"" no more retires
It's who can maintain as they ride on the flames
With gasoline, cop a new beam
Get that super bad dime on the team
And don't lose focus of the ultimate scheme
See?

We a fool, throw your main beez in the pool
No rules imma have to take her back to school
Those dirty mags imma clown like Bernie Mac

Man bullets that'll rip through a
Man the sharks in the water for your daughter
And as you swim farther bitch the sharks getting larger
Cold money spender and not a money lender
Man let a quarter ounce break down in a blender
Man it's Quipto yo and A. Nickatina
It's like Joe and Darryl in shell toe adidas
I'm swimming in the river of the phoenix
Holla at me now hoe forget about the remix
Because I'm reloaded, and all the hoes know it
It might be candy painted man but it's never candy coated
Man it's like a semi when I gotta tell you gimme
Reputation searchin like the henny and the remmy
See that car? Imma cop that, God!
Police ain't around? Gonna spark that, God!
Take this valium and cry about the pain
Or throw them dice and roll with the game
(Queez)
Roll with the game, my homie said feel my pain
Some say that he might rise again
Put your flame to the sky, and strike ya lighters
For Mac Dre just one moment of silence...
Yeah burn your backwood
Thizz dance, wipe your sweat off with a wrist band
Gon' just kick back, keep your lip latched
Me wit your broke hoe, that's the mismatch
Not even if I'm blind and I see pitch black
Please belive imma have it down on this track
One way or another I gotta get your record til they respect my get back

and i can bet that on the past life

and they can show you how to pop it, that coochie

with no time to waste
so let me see you chase the bread
before you get replaced
Chorus: 2x
you in a balla race
trying to get all in a ballas face
workin your hips at a balla pace
wanna see how sweet a balla taste
you in a balla place"

And ain't no way you can touch my....cool
The 12th floor at the Marriot
You know, me and my tigaz chill there a lot
Fetti
I sit alone when the mic's on
With Tyson every time that the fight's on, kill 'em
I remember rhymes used to ride with nets
Flight at the midnight high with jets
You know Al Capone stretched tryi' to save the sets
And I'm teflon down, t shirts and gats
Rhymes you can taste, Rhymes, Rhymes galore
Rhymes you can buy at the candy store
You know who I am, I'm like credit card scam
Hot like soulfood, greens and yams
Extra-curricula, netting that riddicula
Hit the cloud like the bear or the fiddila
Shouldn've lied, I coulda been a good friend to ya
Now i got to get rid of ya

I told my mom somethin' that made her cry
Looked her in the eye and said rappers don't die
We not gonna have an' tour, but we gon get by
So most of us gonna be in hell high, kickin'
Now put the rhyme on a triple beam
Now rock it up, and chop it up,
And try to grind into triple cream
Don't get caught with the same scheme
Meaning don't get caught with the same thing, King
It's like you got to be bald
'cause hoes and niggaz wanna see you go far
I think they mad when I ticks them off
But I'm a hyena so i got to laugh and break some off
The hot wax that's real fatal
Sup'd up to perfection like a weapon on a turntable
They say Gretta's got a new baretta
And he'll be aiming his gat like a crooked letter, foreva
I hit the night like stormy weather
And if you brag about your freak, i'mma say mine's way better
I rotate like the hands of a clock
And find ways to make my rap beat all on your block
You better knock on the door tiga
And lay them all on the floor tiga
'cause i think they want more tiga
I blow em out like a flat tire
And hit the weed for Richard Pryor
Then call em all straight liars
The corks in me like the tail of a fox
So get the grease hot, nigga
Or your tigaz'll be caught"

I don't play football, I'm not a playmaker
My only way deep is to throw a haymaker
School rule breaker
Makin' teachers have a fit
From the Goz show that's how I learn to spit
Man, some All Star Chuck's and some coke to sack
It don't matter what color as long it blue or black

Never in the game that become wet fish

And I'm filled with lies
When we rap all these muthfuckas' die despise
Like the sparrow that narrow
Nigga shootin' through an arrow
You can see the klugg's if you look through the barrel
Fools use chess like a VCR
Worth as much as a CD-R
Gotta put my hands in the cookie jar
You got beef?
Let my rap den rip ya car
Disappear like a motherfuckin' desert mirage
Smellin' so good like a red crosage
That's the way I fuck em' down
Climbs around by sound
Like how them whistles whip through the ground
Get the camera, the ramela, the scramela
Two points the fuck with the camela, SIN
Who cares what mood ya in?
It'll sound like thunda if I lose again
Yeah nickatina I dun told ya the virgin of fame
Im like napoleon you beat like he come in the game
Check's is ready to name
Then I pop the brain
Ain't a law in the world that can stop the case
I wear Adidas
Sometimes Fillas
They're the two leadas'
The boy king
Hit yo bowl, sack, low jeans
At 3am
Yeah the freeway mine
And you can tell by the ticket's I've left behind
You wanna get reckless?
Don't get checklist
Cops motherfucker they respect this
What's on the wishlist?
Man, I can get this
I freak with big lips
And she love the tongue kiss
And cold as a tundre
Seven's the numba
Split up the pie
Or chop it like lumba
Don't forget the thunda that I said
And all praises to Bob Marley's mighty dreads
We need to find someone to hunt down
Think of the turn around
The murder is murder round
Tryin to burn em' down
Reckless
I all blessed it
I hit the stage freak with such freshness
Two t-shirts and ah adidas suit
Im lookin' way too cute
You bitches raise the roof
You got bacardi in ya' body
180 proof
And I'm addicted to ya ass
Like ya' name was truth
I jump in the coop
With a couple of bloods
And bitch fuck ya party if the shit don't bump
Because I'm major fast
I need major cash
And damn your sister got major ass
Homie reckless
They won't respect this
I say the bitch is kinda like a necklace

Sometimes I feel like I'm caught in a verse
Or I'm Bobby Fischer but nobody cared to search
Can't look my mother in the eye no mo'
Can't tell her that the god don't get high no mo'
Its the begining of a train wreck
Hold ya heart cause believe me the camera won't explain it
Or contain it, an angel said ""free""
Was I really what you wanted me to be?
You trust the soul of the icey cold
Because they bump you where guns and the drugs is sold
And where the gods said they're born to roll
And they'll think like this until they gray and old
I think back to when I was drug free, care free
But that was long ago kinda like a memory
Do you remember me? Man it was long ago
We used to like each other livin in the Fillmoe
You never said no I never said hoe
But like I said in the begining that was long ago
And from the start yo you knew I wasnt Mozart
Marvin Gaye always said life comes apart
And like a puzzle, some times it gets worse
I'd probably break down if I step into church
[Equipto]
Man
We had dreams of doin things with money
Its funny how situations get ugly
I usta believe when a girl says she love me
But now I take off, don't look back and keep runnin'
A hundred miles an hour I'm hidin my smile
But now I find time just for writin it down..huh
It's kill joy, I'm still your boy
'til then I'ma build and destroy
And fill the void
I keep sinnin in this sensitive world
Though I've never gotten this for a lesson to learn...(never)
Baby keep askin me when I'd return
Not knowin' I'm a playa in every sense of the word..HUH
My momma cry she know I ain't livin right
Can't legiaimize who I am in her mind
Am I blind or just too ignorant?
I'd give my life to feel that innocent
I can't look back
Bags is packed
Sayin ""Won't nobody know where I'm at"" ..(gone)
Across the map
No contact leave the phone
Rollin stone, and RARELY be at home
I got a plan to get away
Hustlin' a family
We can live for betta days
Or I mean HAPPY
But everything comes with time
ONE HEART
ONE LUV
ONE LIFE

Drugs all deep in the brain on a train with no love
I know it feels insane on a train with no love
I died deep in the brain on a train with no love
Shit, I know it feels insane on a train with no love
Drugs all in the brain on a train with no love
I know it feels insane on a train with no love
Drugs all deep in the brain on a train with no love
[Verse 1]
Man we movin' deep, me and Jay Lee, That's my homie and we up about a ki'
Business is good, got a new wife, I could do this for the rest of my life
Hang with stars, drive fast cars, still wear a vest for protection at the bar
Smoke me a spliff, talk big shit, never in my life will I ever will slip
Don't test me 'cause I'm fast with the steel, bullets come hot but they make cats chill
Ready to kill if a cat comes short, nigga lord have mercy dead on the porch
I gotta do this 'cause I can't hesitate, if I do it too early then I'm comin' in late
Called Jay Lee, he said ""Cool, Man I'm glad you got rid of that fool""
He said, ""There's a concert goin' downtown, The O' Jays, Whispers and James Brown""
""Before you come can you make this round, we got a package comin' off Greyhound""
I said, ""We do? Why you didn't tell me?""
He said, ""I was off with the family""
I thought for a sec then said ""Okay""
That's the homie Jay Lee, that's the homie from the way
Got the information, got to the spot, picked up the drop then I got popped
They said ""We got you"", read me my rights, and all I could think about was my wife
Got to the station, called Jay Lee
He said ""Ain't nothin' I can do for ya homie""
Hung up the phone, I heard the dial tone
Now I'm thinkin', ""What the hell is goin' on?""
Damn
[Verse 2]
I had a good lawyer, I got five years, Jay Lee did it to boost his career
Gave me up, to get a bigger cut and I didn't even see it 'cause I was caught up in the lust
Man this trial done made me broke, nobody's laughin' but I feel like a joke
My wife is there, she's filled with tears, She'll have a new man in five years
I got a cold heart, I ain't gon' lie, but that shit right there made me cry
Trapped in the cell, the first day in my cellmate shanked me in the back with a pen
I could feel it go in, I turned for revenge, he started screamin' I killed his friend
I started to shake, he started to fuss, he said ""Over a god damn six hundred bucks!""
Man he could'a killed me, he started to laugh, he said I'm gonna have to live with my past
Let the demon sit up in my brain from bringin' that pain, from movin' that caine
I'm sittin' there bleedin', shit is misleadin', I'm in a hospital on the very first evening
Grittin' my teeth 'cause life ain't sweet
Now I'm trapped in the belly of the beast, shit
[Verse 3]
Three sixty five, I did it five times and I walked out with ALLAH in my mind
No red meats, I'm back on the streets, thangs done changed, it's a new game
Cats that I knew that was into books done flipped the script and turned into crooks
Homies would say that the playa Jay Lee would always say good things about me
I say ""Fo' real?"", They say ""Fo' real""
Too bad the homie died in a dope deal
""He left you a key for a mailbox, he said sorry 'bout somethin' then stopped
I took the key to the mail box, opened it up, and you know what?
Jay Lee left me 92 G's and a note that read ""would I please
Forgive me friend, for I have sinned.""
""Sometimes we forget what life we're in""
""I know money won't repay the hurt, but maybe it could wash away the dirt""
""'cause we were born with hearts of gold, but as we get old, the heart gets cold""
I folded the note, and kept it with me so I can always be with the homie Jay Lee
I thought good things, like before I done drugs, and before the train with no love
I called my wife, she was surprised
She took me back, now how you love that?
And just like that, I'm out of the game
That was the last stop on that train
Shit, I'ma tell ya...
And that was the last stop on that train"

Glorified, Glorified, Glorified,
Verse: 1
In the game of pain that rang the outlaws
Freaks come through at a 2 no draws
Stop for a sec tiga dont take a pause
If you dont see no pigs then there aint no laws
Get beefy wit me 1 time when i rap
To all them other niggas is like bullets in the back
On the highway going fucka fucka fast
Blowing on a chopper when im mucka mucka mad
Make way steady on the dirty dirty cash
When nothing hurts tiga only when i laugh
Chorus:2x
I glorified the crime rate in my state
The mothafucka thinks is the fliest place
Verse: 2
Die mothafucka you know i aint concerned
You make a mothafucka really do learn
Popeye nigga and go home and eat spinach
Get back on the block i really cant finish
I'm ready to rap till the gods say quit
Until then freaks you gon hear my shit
Parden my manapose and parden my french
And god so check it out, put me in the mix
I'm shooting with my eyes closed at 5-0
Leaving every where i go smelling like a rose
Hanging out the car window whats up hoes
Stepped out and showed the hoes the gangsta pose
Chorus:3x
I glorified the crime rate in my state
The mothafucka thinks is the fliest place
Verse: 3
Your lucky you brothas go boom bang bang
I'm married to the game with a gold weddin' rang
Keep ur daughtars chain my eyes never change
Hard to break like a cuban link chain
Stay back fo a while the mayne in livin color
Instead of right next to me mothafucka
Die yall hi yall fry yall
Spit the truth tell the youth its a lie yall
The only advice i can give to a brotha
is fire up the weed motha fucka
Check it
Chorus:3x
I glorified the crime rate in my state
The motha fucka thinks is the fliest place
Shit can u understand now, I'm glorified"

Stretch like rubber
I make sure payments like the ultimate cutter
I stand like a statue in the church i feel cold
Trapped like a cat wit a boat full of coke
Tigas know I lie

This is how I run my life
Razor sharp just like the knives
Mics get hit from buller flavor i spit
Chambers and clips can't offer me shit
I get high as fuck when them MC's come
But from dawn to dusk man I breaks em up
Like booyah! What ya do now!?
I can hear them freaks screamin Hoocha!
From head to head

Niggas be trippin when the endos gone
Niggas be trippin when they womans gone
Niggas be trippin when the moneys gone
Thats why I rappin on the microphone
What up, razor sharp
Crack Raider
Time to build my juice back up
Like the curl of a banger in a compton cut
How many niggas do i have to kill
Before i go to the top of the hill
Don't need to be alarmed because my game is tight
You know i do it for the gods when i rock the mic
You know i'm really wheel spinnin and my hammer keep bustin
You be a fool and these cats i'm trustin
Cold as ice he must be cold as steel
I'm gon bury yo ass at the top of the hill come on
Razor sharp
Rap Raider razor
Raider sharp
Rap raider razor raider sharp
A tiga like me can't hit the block
Sucka mc's is like microphone cops
Niggas know Nicky got a brain for glocks
So when i think niggas come at they usual spots
Nose stay red like the 1st reindeer
Don't know where you goin but ya can't stay here
Gotta hit the scene all stars and jeans
Slip through the scene like vaseline cream
Supreme being one man team
The king diamonds wit the heart of his queen
No matter the ride check it i'm gon lean
Wit a hook that niggas aint seen since kareem
I'm a fugitive gotta watch my step
Suckas wanna kno where the rhymes is kept
Check this out playboy hold ya breath
I'm on the bay bridge they ain't caught me yet
Goin ninetyyyy on the freeway chokin
Aint no mystery to the weed we smokin
Andre nickatina said show me some styles
And check this out freak i'ma be right back
I hate to be a whore but the worlds a pimp
I'm tryin to tell my tigas man don't y'all simp
Comin like a mack truck
Miss me if ya foul skunk
Represent the blunt when ya get tossed up
Microphone flow like the caddy will rip
And this sugar hill gang got me doin this so

I remember he told me... calm down, calm down, calm down, calm down
Ya, God forgets my soul when I'm doing bad
the pain I'm feelin when living life too fast
so calm down were the words that I heard last
my ear drums are still numb from the first blast
I couldn't turn back past the grave into my head for the dead
putting ash in graves
and I smoke with the spirit so feel me rise
over the clouds for now up until we die, it's like that
I set off through the star spangled
looking for a light to guide me to an angel
gotta be smart and hide behind all the answers
when everythings dark my heart is full of anger
(Nikatina)
I rather be a bull for a day than a goat forever
my life is a joke so whatever
man prime time reason and rhyme, you know the rhyme be the reason
sling shots and Chuck Taylors, it's the season
there is no state of the art or no special effects
it's just money, politics, and these projects
can you imagine yo a playboy thats kickin it live
but in his own damn mind yo hes doin time
now thats deeper than the craters on the moon
crushin up weed in the back dressing room
I hate to be greedy but I love to be greedy
hope the little guy love me but dont be me
I do it like a gene, blaze in a beenie
life time contract and no you cant free me, Queezy
(Equipto)
ya we live and die it's all for the cash flow
dont give replies, I'm high and we act cold
i dont know why I couldnt explain
lost focus of the love in the innocent way, live for the day
hey I'ma escape to the music, to try to make up for all the wrong that I'm doin
I swear I know better, but so far gone
and no gaurd hear the cry out in every song
it's upon everybody through moods of stars
rise and fall im there with my open arms
(Nikatina)
man it's such a rush that I get when the money is spent, and all the dope is lit,
man this is how I repent, I keep a devils eye on tigas that spit the gift
and is it true in the after; like the souls adrift?
thats kamakazi logic, man the ghetto is the topic
you trying to cop it, you gotta sell it then you drop it
it's like its hot cause if its not then the plot starts to thicken
I'm sorry but moneys a religion, fly like a pigeon
man whats your decision? the homies is waiting in the Fillmoe division
rap life living, fast cars driven, it's something like prison
but this is how we listen, listen
go ahead and bounce homie... get up outta here... get up outta here... it's like that... it's like that...
it's like that... it's like that..."

i would hang like the chain on your neck man

they say that i can fix a broken jam

we've been closer you see pieces of my broken heart
caught in a verse and i embraced it
mentally and physically its something like a face lift

then i start to walk around like im fuckin famous
broken man
-Equipto
everybody say its love but all you feel is hate
till i had enough im mackin like a chouma stake
i violated through traffic and tribulations
just to put some smiles on their faces
always being anxious city of gangsta alibi's
face off just true lies
everything is a mariage and your mind is a collage
ive seen through flaws
im a rebel wit out a pause define laws
will i define raw in wicked ways
i caught up of how im livin today
put away the stress and i can smile
this is happy as i am
you know this is forever
except the pieces of a man

She said my stick was ???, so she knew just where to bury it
This girl named Sequoia, she was from Illinois-a
I had to stuff her mouth with her teddy bear, 'cause she made hella noise-a
This freak named Nikita Brown, I rode her like a merry-go-round
She got to telling all her friends, that it's a new king in town
I was on my way to Las Vegas when I bumped into Tessy
She said her nickname was Marvin, 'cause when she had sex it got messy
This freak named Jenny Marquais, so you know I called her Butter
'cause when it came to summer sundresses, she had ass like no other
The steak was always smothered, she was a freak under the covers
You should have seen my expression, lil' pimpin,
when I got hit on by her mother
This young lady named Chanelle, she was fine as hell
But she was 26, and her son was already twelve
I was at this little assembly, when I chopped it up with Kimberly
Hit it, split it, man that freak said she'd love me for infinity
You should have seen the chemistry, I changed that freak's identity
Seen her at the movies with her man, and the bitch didn't wanna remember me
This girl named Chamere, she put diamonds in my ears
But she also tried to put these niggas on me when I slapped her at the pier
This girl named Cheryl Lynn, she had hella friends
So when I brought my friends and all her friends,
then that's when the party began
This girl named Savannah, she used to love to pout
But I used to say ""Don't even trip, just stick this in your mouth""
This freak named Miranda, she thought I couldn't stand her
But yeah, I can stand ya, since I got your ass on camera
I was riding hard, like Humphrey Bogart, with this freak named Leah
Even though she was in the dark, no one could see her, get it?
This freak named Raquela, she worked at Pac Bell-a
She gave me the number to the pager, home, and cellular
She had a lovely smell-a, ass like ???
I was wet like a scuba diver from the sex, homeboy let me tell ya
Chrysler ???, with this chick named Darren
I was at the mall trying to buy some clothes, and she just kept on starin
And then came the flarin, she said she hated sharin
I said ""I'm not your man, little freak, so I'm not really carin""
This gangsta's name was Dallion, she wore gold medallions
Every other month we'd take a flight, out to Staten Island
She kept a 9 on the dresser 'cause she had dreams of hell
Even though we in the penthouse suite of a 5-star hotel
I rock and I rock well, that's what I told Gail
She's a conceited little fraternity freak, up there at Yale
Young tender named Divine, I bump in her Alpine
She was the type that looked so good, it was a motherfuckin crime
Took her from behind, led her to the ride
Baby didn't make it home till the sun was 'bout to rise
Kickin in with Corvette, baby had a Corvette
She used to come and get young Nickatina from off of the set
We strikes to the checks, she pick up her Lex
We hit Hotel Nico, you know what came next
I was payin my bill for cable, when I met up with Sable
Green eyes, it was a CEO, of a record label
But I didn't get to hit it, because I met with Bridget
She was Sable's secretary, that gave me head and digits
In the parking lot of a club one night, I ran into Kirby
Freak worked at a beauty shop, said some gangsta's tryin to serve me
Freak you ain't worthy, your gossip column is through
And if some cats is after me, I'm right here mackin on you
Had to pop the collar on my coat, rev up the vogue smoke
Looked her in the eyes and said ""Yeah bitch, you're broke!""
This girl named ???, Lord she was dreamy
Met her at a pool party, should have seen her bikini
This lady's name was Val, her husband was my pal
She offered me to put in why he stressed the ?rikers out?
Gave the freak a smile, said ""It ain't my style""
I've known the homie for a while yo, and that would be foul

It bring a tear to my eye, when thinkin' what we all became
I put it on the table when it came to my family
The expression on my face don't mean that I'm angry
I seen so many thangs, don't know what to expect
And there'll be thangs that your weatherman couldn't predict
Your world shift everyday, switch, things could get hectic
A single incident can change your whole perspective
...(?) life, roll dice, and continue to ...(?)
Move fast, ain't no time to wait for funk to settle
I'm at my prime, in order there's a time and place
A night, escape, look deep into my mind state
Homies roll aimless, the attitude we hold is contagious
Yet you can't blame us on how tight the game iz
Laced is how we do the beat, or rollin' through the street
Handle business, pullin' all nightas, and losin' sleep
Do what I gotta do...
""Hey, I'mma holla at y'all later, I'ma get at you
I just gotta handle sumthin' real quick""
[Chorus]
Do what I gotta do...
I'm out and about bouncin', makin' it all count when I
Do what I gotta do...
And I'm doin' it now because there'll never be a later
Do what I gotta do...
'cause life's so hard with no paper
Ever since my homie Joe died
he turned to his side and left the world (with) closed eyez
Everythang got crucial, made it look easy, done perfectly, no lie
Handle'n those(?), and emergency times
No other dreams seemed bigger than chase
you could tell it by the look on all my homie's face
Ignore distractions
Baby complainin' that I'm a player
she can die with me now and she can live with me later
In life, that's how I put it in the land of the crooked
Give me anythang, I'ma break it down and jerk(?) it
Into a grime, combine it with a fresh rhyme
Gotta do it now (why?) there'll never be a next time
Baby, gotta do what I gotta do
It's all true, prepare for the scare 'cause anythang could fall through
When there's no money and mean(?) muggin' 'cause you're so hungry
In the game, high and relyin' on nobody
I'm straight pro, give me a beat and I bust it
And I'm out makin' moves, just me and my cousin
It's all family, helpin' each other throughout the struggle
We build a corporation, on years of hustle
Now we
[Chorus]
Do what I gotta do...
Stay alive in these times and write rhymes through hard times
Do what I gotta do...
I'm out and about bouncin', makin' it all count when I
Do what I gotta do...
Doin' it now because there'll never be a later
Do what I gotta do...
'cause life's so hard with no paper
It's like 286 on a 747, I've never been so close to heaven
A natural high, the best way to describe
When you arrive, worldwide, with innocent eyez for the first time
You'll turn back, recognize the beauty
Accept responsibility, realize the duty
I'm gettin' looney when I wanna
and handlin' my business like there's no tomorrow
I'm on a daily schedule, way too deep in it to let it go
I bring out the little things like a telescope
I gotta find my prize and go behind, no more stayin' on my mind
Like my momma all the time
Sayin' to get mine, parkin'(?) a low price
Pay dues, (what?) it's like I've been rappin' my whole life
Precise is precision, seen through one's vision
Carry the crown, king, and everyone will listen
I'm here to play my part, just play your position
Provide my whole heart, forget recognition
It's time, we all go beyond a situation and waitin'
I'm way too tired to be patient
Runnin' around and heart pacin'
Under the ground, the studio still creatin'
We makin' it through, and everything I've done and do for the crew
And always kept it true,
To do what I gotta do...
(Chorus)"

Motherfuckers play for keeps so niggas lose they life
Money comes in different ways, the dope game's kinda slow
Niggas used to havin money are lookin kinda po'
Dank or dope, there ain't no hope these niggas peelin' caps
Gangstas pullin major leagues and brag about the jack
Situation critical this chewy got me stuck
Indo calm a nigga down but keeps a nigga pumped
My partners mamas smokin rocks and turns into a ho
And since they fuck with that right nigga the gat will snort and blow
Killas move in silence and the jokers run they mouth
Fightin fools that don't exist take that nigga out
'Cause his love is murder, two jack burgers takin your respect
Coke and dank sex then baked your homies in the set
So flash yo cash and whoop your ass if you've got more than me
And whatever you got is more than mine so nigga let me see
'Cause jealousy's reality when it comes to niggas bread
And snitches go from rags to riches rattin' to the feds
Cause coke is queen and money is king and niggas want the crown
So all you niggas goin up you fuckers goin down
The situations critical with stories on the streets
Kill em dead and get yo bread but make sure that you eat
But I ain't done yet
The situations critical
My baby's momas trippin, got my son and I can't keep him
Wanna cry to hear him on the phone, but she won't let me see him
This chewy got me paranoid and goin kinda scared
Niggas startin to know my face so I had to cut my hair
'Cause nigga, shit is gettin thick from here to Alabama
'Cause every nigga's tryin ta like Tony ""Face"" Montana
Some niggas talk about they'll kill, but nigga no you won't
Some niggas that dream of playin hoop but end up sellin dope
'Cause 3, 6, 5 like everyday man dolja takes it toll
And motherfuckas live to be a G Original
'Cause kill groups, its keys the juke, and rubber band they G's
Money shows this ain't no joke, well bow down to your knees
Situation critical, fuck a 9 to 5
Chewy got these niggas amped and they ain't scared to die
So miss me with that bullshit and hit me with that bank
Miss me with that bammer bitch and rush me with that dank
Time is runnin out partna, time ain't runnin in
My freedom is the only life, so fuck the fuckin pen
So as I chew my juicy fruit and think about the dead
And all my niggas that had died because they had some bread
My mind is on another level nigga this is typical
Check my eyes I'm dyin inside, situations critical
Situations critical
Niggas dressin rich, knowin they broke without a doubt
Born and raised in the same hood in a roach infested house
Situation critical I think I'm bout to die
The enemy is creepin up and fuckin off my high
A nigga hit the 5th and makes it home in desperation
Wipe the sweat, hold my chest, and then I plot retaliation
Now before you clown you best calm down cause I read you like a book
Now must you stare cause I don't care, cause I won't even look
Thangs ain't what they used to be a motherfucka told ya
Niggas got the mind to kill and that includes the rollers
'Cause 2, 4, 7 like everyday niggas servin cluckers
Beatin up the bustas, fuckin Tommy Tuckers
Some niggas say they gangstas and they love when money folds
But mosta the time these niggas be beefin over hoes
'Cause pussy comes a savage beast and it also makes you broke
Especially when that sexy freak is snortin all your coke
So check my situation fool and check my state of mind
No matter how you makin paper nigga, thats a grind
My indo have an increase this week from eighth up to a half
And nothin funny motherfucka, nigga why you laugh?
So fuck this fame and fuck these records, motherfuck these raps
My mother's broke there ain't no hope, her son ain't got no snaps
Its the same old song I'm doin wrong, fool this is typical
Fuck the fuckin world mama, situations critical

I'm true to the dope that I smoke no joke
Check me right now there's a gram in my coat
Cocaine blunts (what?) and hip hop tapes (what?)
Rubber car keys and ID that's fake
And rhymes do pay so my pockets do grow
I snort so much snow that they should call me Dre Blow
'cause I don't drink beer I don't drink gin
Bust the freak hit the pussy then I try to fuck her friends
Dre Dog don't laugh ain't a damn thing funny
When niggas talk to freaks who ain't got no money
I done smoke enough blunts fool to fill my brain
Chewy boy do me raw cut cocaine

A rap cat with the BOSS apparel

Money and dope, man, don't come for free
Man, I don't have no competition, ho, all I got is enemies
I turn around like a tornado
Rock it like a baby cradle
Call me Doctor J if you a baller and it's getting fatal
I make MC's do angel dust
Take 'em to the Bay Bridge, make 'em strip, tell 'em jump
I don't know why I get high
I'm so in love with money I keep spending 'til it runs dry
Hot like a kettle, when the pedal hits the metal
Pinocchio you know son is Jepetio, hello
Deep fried just like Friday fish
A lot a hot sauce, now we got it popping in this bitch
Yeah, in anything I do I put my everything
Always feeling deep inside just like Mary J.
Ha, I'm never panicing, I'm bored stiff as a mannequin
Grew up fast just like Anakin
Baby its gullible, its Alice in Wonderland
All the excuses in the world I can't understand
Cause I'm a man of these times, the man to get high
Blow big, but my gross is family time
Ain't no way to intervene in my industry
Moving quicker then a centipede on enemies

It goes on, as long as time commences

With the force that the courts call the last Jedi
I'm like a veteran, off Excedrin's
Cause I be getting headaches from these Letterman's
I asked this little freak about my rap style
She said, ""It's so damn dope they might take you to trial.""
I hit the weed like I'm kamikaze next to the cosmos
Chopping up shit, yeah, with Quipto and Vago
Raps like a Tommy gun, watch how the body run
Raps from the Tommy gun will make anybody run
I'm bout to go in like a movie, but no stunt double so parachute me
But somehow I feel I survived on a fluky
I have to hit the scene, livin' out my dreams
Then I said I was sorry to DJ's and MC's
Complete to everyone who kept their ear to the street
Then my homie came through with the Al Capone Suite
Got twice as deep, don't forget, you know how low they get
Intimidating so I pose a threat
Coming like a slider, right by ya
Known to drop a rhyme in on time, and prescribing accurate alignment
The center of attention, we'll bend a agenda
To enter this rap game the number one contender
The outta sight, and dope lyrical white, and watchin' tricks fightin'
Hyping up the crowd late night, and watching Tennessee Titans
Everybody just loving because we like and
I strike in first class light fast, just like lightning
I force my rhymes in your veins like hot shot of heroin
You'll got cold turkey trying to work me
It's like a pad lock, when you in the headlock
Six in the morning and you didn't here the Feds knock
[Chorus]
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting
I'm consistent, adding all statistics
Why don't we cover the spread like the bitch never existed
Phonographic rotate the plastic spinning
Living like I'm knowing it's gonna be a drastic ending
Playing classics, meditating these tactics to overcome
The show is done, anticipating to roll a blunt
Baby, getting anxious, hitting and I can't miss the focal point
When locals say, ""He ain't shit.""
Man it's Equipto, put it all down for my homies
And rolling my weed right next to the police
Nothing but love for all my homeboys hustling drugs
Up in your program fucking it up
I'm in the fast lane, the cash lane, some think it's a bad thing
Hitting 'em off with the see & H pure cane
I get stuck in your membrane
I'm like a pimp at a party when you say look at them rings
I use a Motorola, the mood is baking soda
Whether it's in Denver, man, Houston, man, or North Dakota
With no apology, tech-tech-tech technology
Some brother disin' me, or even thinkin' he
I got the soul and the spirit of the wrath of Kahn
Kick back and write just like the holy Koran
[Chorus:Repeat x2]
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
When they hit me with the thunder and lightning
Its trifling, enlightening, and frightening
Some might think that it's even exciting"

From moving banking soda
Man bullets dance like clubs on them hot corners
I kick it live and wicked
Like a winning lotto ticket
Man hide your money
Hide your dope
And hide your ruler biscuit
It's like so devestated
The way i stay so jaded
So keep your clorox when you see me 'cause I cant be faded
Its about that scrilla mail
Some suckas bite they nails
'cause they just sold their soul like a crack sale
All outta black mail
All in them packed jails

But check it out i see ya
But wouldnt wanna be ya

Your favorite icecream flavour
Your city county mayor
Alaskin polar bear
A Maserati that halts the freeway
In a majorway
Man get at me today YO! SO!

Some cats they welcome back man

Snap back like alligator
8 packs of nowandlaters

Talk shit with major players
Stay away from space invador cock blockin playa haters

No matter what the reason
And i be screaming at demons until i aint breathin

You might escape you jail but you wont escape hell
Wit that in mind you can always make mail
Fuck around hoe 'cause I jus cant fail
I got a court case Friday that jus might stick
And I'm writing on a brick at the Motel 6
For these dirty lawyer fee's that cost a grip
If he delay the trial then it's all legit
When it comes to stress I stress the best
Meanin that its all up in my flesh
Meanin that sometime I cant rest
Its 4 a.m. and I'm smokin sess

You say you want it all
You say forget the law
And everything you saw, you copped it from the raw
You gon' be like the ones in sky
And for a sec I was bout to ask why
But we was broke
It's 83' with a street gleam
And young cats is rockin up and gettin' street teams
And motherfuckers that hate me and want me to die
Man they can see that I'm broke in my eye
I need to do it, I need to talk to Twinky, he'd probably front me somethin
He made 20 g's, outta straight nothin'
And Pee Wee bought a 69' cutty
That niggaz mackin bitches makin money
That shit ain't funny
'cause I'm a go get her and makin thangs iller
It's like a pain killer, but it's much realer
And in my callin' I could see the scrilla
Playboy just said coke dealer, man I'ma try
We had a lunch date, in 1988
And from your sad face, you said you caught a case
But besides that the money was pilin' up, business was doin good
You movin' on thru the hood
Got you a house no doubt in Vallejo
For $700 ounce you gon' drop straight yayo
Niggaz be talkin bad, sometimes I be gettin' mad
I just gotta gun, yo my mother said don't call
And like paper I was ripped apart
Because you know that my mother is my heart
I feel ashamed, 'cause im'a blast first up in the game
It ain't a mystery to me, money close at range
'cause these bitches be talkin shit
I live by the crucifix
Because of my pathways, party my last day
Praise to the double glock
I've smoken so much pot
I don't know if I like it or not
I got beef wit the Barry brothers
They started hearin' my name up in the game
And told the undercovers
Yeah so here we go round and round
The streets don't make a sound
Don't they come uptown, nigga we cut em' down
And thats the mind state for all those niggaz
Rats bitin' cheese yeah all those squeelers
Till the devil come and get us yeah they all gon' feel us
Don't make it hard for coke dealers
Word life..
Ok it's 92', now what you gonna do?
I heard you killed a guard, in ya fightin squad
He said Nicky man you know the street theory
I can't let the competition near me
I hate em' dearly
I'm so out of control in my life
Live by the sword and die by the knife
My mother called to give her best
The police picked up the phone started to laugh
And said he's under arrest
I felt pain in my heart from a thousand whips
Man, I wish I had never learned to bag a zip
You should have seen they face when I payed my bail
It was the look of the devil thats gon' send me to hell
I made a call and I got a pot
'cause when it comes to this lawyer
He wants the money man there ain't no disguise
And these bitches with these cold hearts
Man they be tellin' they friends
That I'm a give em' a gang of ends and then
My misery is legendary
And I could hear the old coke dealers cryin at the cemetary
I'm in the fast lane with no brakes
And when it comes to this money
I need a bakery to cook these cakes
Man I'm goin to hell
Or I'm a die in jail
Or these bullets gon' rain
And I'm gonna get nailed
Cut cut cut me down Nicky
It make me wanna shiver
The lost soul of a coke dealer"

My Vocabularies vary, its so exclusionary
You'll find my baby pictures in modern dictionaries
Next to mighty mercenaries, and visual visionaries
And sexy freaks eating strawberries
I represent my mind in the 415 dime
Tryin' to stop my rhyme is like tryin' to stop crime
I float like an eagle that soars through the sky
And hit the murder scene in the perfect disguise
[Hook]
In my rap world we bump 75 girls
Playboy short, right before court
staring at the judge like 'what you talking bout?'
You told me to take the stick of gum out my mouth
See I'm a devil in the street from the serious rhyme
But still I'm an angel in my Mamas eyes
In my rap world, WE BUMP 75 GIRLS
PLAYBOY SHORT, RIGHT BEFORE COURT
[Verse 2]
Try to bite what I write and it'll break ya jaw
Andre Nickatina right here in the raw
Ain't no real rap lord gon' respect the law
Get the phone, page my little cousin Bobby Shaw
Shuffle like a CD changer, the rearranger
Baby hold me tight like the gun of a banger
In the frame of the game leave my name on your brain
Until we meet again it will never be the same
Slice my own piece of the true money pie
When is it cool for a real cat to cry?
I hit the sky like a bullet that's shot at the moon
Ride the wind like a wicked witch tipping her broom
Keep your eyes on the deck, check, 52 card bet
Heart bumping through his chest, I love it when I see him sweat...
In my rap world, SHIT, 75 GIRLS...
[Verse 3]
Expose the theory of remarkable worldwinds
Beats I wish I could sex like my girlfriends
Party 'til dawn on them hoes like its the first
Who gon' keep on talking when the 4-4's burst?
Smokin' weed like its legal, possessed by the words
The world is a ghetto man there ain't no birds
I got a solid gold crown that I'll never wear
'Cause I know Tommy Tuckers want me to share

Temper like a phoneix when I open my eyes
And mash on it crash on it blast on it
Count your money put your stash on it cash on it

Have you ever seen the tears of a clown get down
Bring yo life jacket 'cause you just might drown
Have you ever seen the tears of a clown
Rapid fire from the empire wit no desire
Walking on a tight wire born again liar
You might not understand my love for rap
But until then show me where the money's at
And my tigers want cognac courvoisier
Clownin' on freaks anytime of the day
With no pause no shame no game no blame

Fire up tuff on the gangsta streets
Steer to the reer like a clear alear jet
Hit the corner like a shadow with the grey siloette

I gotta clown something when the hoes start frontin
And why I stay high off mary j. Blige
And when there's a drought all birds do fly
All through the air 'till they hit yo set
And if you talk too much then you will get wet

Up in your face man with something
To sell

Behind the wheel

Make a deal

I'm not a screw face, I keep my
Boots laced
And listen to the homies brag about
They gun case
They off taste, crank beat with more bass
My court date, and I came in hella late
The cross game, wear rings with no chains
Holla at the guard if you a rap cat mane
Nickel plated, now the engergys penetrated
I put that on my life I'm glad you never made it
Raw hide, all in my blood line
You never find a drug like me and no kine
Don't hide, cause it makes it more divine
To put you in the firing line on valentines
February, or was it January
I lose my memory when it come to you canaries
Its necessary, on guard with what you carry
Split the middle of the swicher then add the blueberry

Rip hearts and I pound the sky larks

Hot days, means pistols in the shade
It ain't strange, motherfucker you sell cane
Add a little color to the picture frame
The rhyme cheetah, throw on the wife beater
T-shirt jeans tennis shoes didn't see ya
And this analogy, is a new strategy
And this academy is headed for a tragedy
It sounds to me that you're tryin to break free
And snakes like me don't allow that see
At close range you can see my vertigo
Venom in the soul and I'm ready to let it go
With no control, man it can grow like a rose
And I'm standing right there in my Filmo' pose
When a child cries, in the heart a father dies
Punch you in the eye to let you know that you alive
Lethal, multiply to equal
Bumpin see-bo on the way to Tahoe
I'm stage left, at the store remian chef
Man cook it up and keep it from the A-T-F
The barracuda, yo the rhyme roof shoota

And rip it in the lobby man while kickin it with bobby

Keep my nails cut with precision
add and multiply division
money makins how im livin
smokin weed up in the kitchen
you feel 'aight
im at the bird like a steam ray southern like a ghost
turn around and dissappear or somthin like a ghost
lookin like a cat that just got chose
smellin like a rolls closin all four doors"

What that deuce, deuce poppin' like?
Baby, I like the way you work that tongue
You had a don't care nigga for 3 weeks sprung
It's the game, the muthafucka calls my name
Product made of yola 'cuz the rules don't change
The prettiest thing is new white wall tires
I shoulda been a lawyer 'cuz I'm such a good liar
Kill dosia style, brain child in a beanie
God fear a nigga under pressure and greedy
Microphone cops steady fuckin' off my dealings
Even when I'm workin', muthafuckas think I'm chillin'
Recruitin' like the army or even the marines
Some get rejected like black, jelly beans
I'm on the scene in my jeans, smokin' weed from a sac
Muthafucka, where you at? I got cocaine raps
Ya hardcore CB4 uproar made a nice comeback
But didn't touch my score
A Farrakhan listener, white world prisoner
My frisk down is just like the state pen for visitors
Ghetto red hots, guns, crack and macks, fly clubs
No love and cocaine raps
Spendin' ways incredible, money untraceable
Tiga's start to jack when the dope ain't available
Baby you talk too much, pass the blunt
I'm tryin', to give your fine ass the raw and uncut
I got no time to be a crybaby fool
Forgive me, but they got me packin' pocket tools
Fresh out say fuck 'em, yeah, I made a gang of raps
Smokin' weed in a rental with the gangsta tracks
Straight chewy, and a nigga got a gang of pride
Check the battle or the struggle through my Chinese eyes
Had to tighten up the fade, got my murder 1 shades
Still tryin' to fuck them freaks from my high school days
B. Adams, do you still love me?
'Cuz ya first born is strugglin' and it's hard to stay drug free
Cock back loaded and about to explode
Like the 12 story 'jects, bitch I'm outta control
Alpine reliant, police defiant, Kentucky Fried and Popeye's number 1 client
Two piece pings n rice allspice
N an RX-7 cuttin' through'a da night
I represent the look like the great Sam Cook
Put a star by every freak in my true black book
Clutch tight fist pumped way in the air, pagan
You dealin' with a microphone bear
Tear, pear, glare, where? Stare, check it, I don't care
I just can't quit, shit, the rap game fanatic
Tryna stay calm with a mad weed habit
Cussin' and fussin' at 100 degrees
I think like a blind thief with the vision of G's
Chewy used to do me, listen to Ice-T
Ya lookin' at a nigga who wish he was drug free
But nigga that's a dream in another life
So, until then my last word is re-light"

Without a doubt.

Stick in ya mind, stick in ya mind, stick in ya mind...
[Verse 1]
When you up all night
You see things you shouldn't have saw
Because the night gets raw
Drama is thicker than Skippy's peanut butter
Imagine the worried thoughts of a young man's mother
Feelin's empty, Love don't live here anymore
Awake like an owl at a quarter to four
Don't blink, a Caddy just ran a red light
Bumpin' thug life, man I blend with the night
They call me greedy
25 cents to get a girl a beaty
It's Andre Nickatina
I'm like a genie in a beanie
El Dorado '88 Cadillac, all black
Copy cats try to match
But they style ain't exactly the same
Somebody said ""Freeze it's a raid!""
You know cops are comin' when a brotha smells
Glazed doughnuts, hold up
Partna fill it to the rim
Me and money go together like a feather in a brim
I'm a magician
Some say I'm a thief (?) but I ain't trippin'
A girl be yellin...(?) I don't listen
Crooked crow
Playas seem to like my style
Why's that killa whale...
[Chorus]:
I stay awake like an owl, Hoo!
I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo!
I stay awake like an owl, Hoo!
I stay awake like an owl, Hoo, Hoo!
[Verse 2]
(What are ya baby?)
I'm a Raider, camouflaged in silver and the black
Tryin' to blitz through the line for the quarter back sack
Of the money
I dress like it's cold, not sunny
But slyer than a Persian fox tryin' to catch a bunny
In the snow
I'm try'na get paid like a ho
Or better yet the pimp that's rakin' in her dough
Like a baker
But check it, who's the king of the caine?
And what's that tiga's name with the Macintosh computer brain mind
Or should I say mine?
Sometimes I gotta lie to protect my crime
I call my lawyer!
Bail bonds keep me on the streets
Three in the mornin' I'm at the club with the freaks
But I got hawk eye
Meanin' that the joint is bein' watched
Drinkin' with the killas that be pushin' up the cost
For the drought season
Pound season
Dippers at they best
But those be the ones that don't have to rest
Like an owl...
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I set a trap, I have to spin a web like a spider
Don't strike matches, hate child-proof lighters
Stay awake
Witness I pick up the pace
First I see a girl's butt, then I look at her face
I can't explain
I'm eatin' garlic bread with the steak
Well, killa where the sale came from just when the sale tanks
The patty cart, the eagles is the code for the narcs
Brothas droppin' cream by the fiends when they part
I'm like a sentinel, known to be the principal original
Lookin' for the road that made of gold they call it federal
I'm a general, but yet at times I blaze with my lieutenant
Popeye, no more weed or blunts, who got the spinach?
Cough, choke, feelin' no remorse for the roach
Choppin' up freaks as ya lounge with your folks
Playin' dice, you take a chance at the crap game
It's all about the money baby, it's the rap game
And I'm an owl...

Uh... And I'm out

You can't creamate me down to the ashes
don't wanna see my momma cryin' over a casket
now fast i like man my life's like a party
envisions of me diein like im were cindy and marchy(?)
i was real deal razor, playin through all the drama
from coke deals high heels all of the karma, comin back
every breath fufilling a slow death
although you know i can't expect anythin less
i was the front line just to fight your battle
like the chay at the bay, it's just me and my shadow
i handle it till im gone, and old with arthritis
the grinds and the hustles drugs and all nightas
i went through all the static, hoes and automatic
back to back cravin the bad habit, drugs
you know ima tell it all on the microphone
and i feel it in my heart ima die alone
Andre:
Die alone
it might be a reala cou de thai
imagine if you heard every rhyme
man picture every line
man touch every fine ass dime
man magic on the tire make em shime
man ima die alone, its just like the bullets and the chrome
your there but your really not at home
you hear the death tone through the phone
laugh and yah gone, everything right i get wrong
man im the vegas type, man what the paper like
man holla back homie when you get yah paper right
man ima die alone, roll in a benz all alone
wrapp me like a mummie, egypt pharoah
man sock it to my pocket like a rocket
forever deeze words i keep my photo in your locket
man sweet as cotton candy, or even jolly ranchers
the fo fo matters cause its about pink gathers
man im alone, i can't put my wings on my own
i look like an eagle when they get fully grown
on the ropes, the gods say roll up the dope
and like stacey lathersahl hit ever note
till im broke, man even tho it's butta
they say yo soul retreats to the gutta
with all the othas, no happiness shown
they show you from the gate baby you can die alone
You can die alone"

When I met you baby, you was for sale
I just stepped out of the county jail
For a punk ass misdemeanor
My P.O. dont like Nickatina
And an old man was lettin' ya go
And I could see I was what you was looking for
He said bring me a G, then next week a G
I said ""Check this out pops I'm back tomorrow at 3""
Dont worry how I got that G
Just worry I was right back there at 3
Started you up, and it was legit
I never thought I'd fall in love so quick
Filled you up with gasoline
Took you to the wash spot and got ya clean
Cleaned the dash, rubbed that ass
And everything was slow, I didnt do it fast
Man it took about an hours time
But you looked so fine from the waxy shine
And on my mind I thought about the Alpines
So I loaded your behind with some 6 x 9's
So when you sing people hear you sang
I'm a nigga so baby I'm a do these thangs
Pioneers blastin' out Aretha Franklin
Sometimes I'm wonderin' what you thankin'
[Chorus 2x]
My ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)
You dont fake, steal, cheat, or lie
My ride (my ride), my ride (my ride)
And our relationship is classified
[Verse 2]
I remember the day I bought me some Timbs
That was the same damn day I bought you some rims
At Kims, in the city of dope
And once we hit the streets, me and you, we smoked
On weed, wrapped in chocolate phillies
Other freaks saw us and they went silly
I remember ones name, her name was Billy
The other was a cousin out of Kansas City
They'll drop they clothes, I suppose
But meanwhile my baby girl needs some vogues
She told me everything that was on her mind
Who she loved, who she despised
Why she like the night way better than the day
And did I like Ali or Casius Clay?
I said ""I like your conversation how you shoot to kill
But whats this strange relationship?""
She said if I can hang, than she can hang
And we'll never hit the bay bridge in the slow lane
No thang, like bangers bang
And she hate the police just as much as me mayne
[Chorus 2x]
I could feel you get jealous when I rented a freak
Your carborator had you layin' up for weeks
Then we smoked like friends, put that to an end
Now I'm back in her muthafuckin' heart again
Cleaned your leather, got a darker tint
Over the rearview got the cherry scent
Hit the streets, like mean Joe Greene
Thats when I told her about my scheme
A night trip back and forth from L.A.
So I'm a have to leave you for about a day
It was cool, L.A.'s the spot
But I couldnt wait to see my lady on the block
But just like a bullet had hit my spine
As soon as the focus had hit my eyes
My fist tightened up, I was mad and stunned
My baby was the victim of a hit and run
She was cryin', she said Dre, man I look so ugly
Is there a way you'll ever love me?... Nope
She seen it in my eyes
A brand new vision of a brand new ride
[Chorus 2x]
New ride (new ride), New ride (new ride)
That wont fake, steal, or lie
New ride (new ride), New ride (new ride)
And out relationship is classified
Check it...
To my tiga grand wizard
Its me
What (what)
Check it"

With dealas, feelas, niggaz, women, yea drugs and macks
I hit the mike like a bottle of Courvoisier
And just when I was about to play man it went this way
A gun was shot up in the place man bu-buck buck buck
I seen this cat by the bar gett stuck stuck stuck
And other cats by the bar man pulled out their glocks
And that's when the whole place had got like piping hot
Man bitches screaming

Cause after that I think I heard like four shots
And all I remember after that was seeing the light
And security singing Nicky you goin' be all right
I'm hella numb and getting cold cause there is no pain
The bullets caught me as I was trying to get off the stage
I think about my momma yea you know the lord Sher Khan
And in the back of my mind I wish I had some bomb

Bullets from behind wit your peoples

Chuck Taylor down in a beanie, the kill genie
State the state and face the face crop the bass
The rap the race the rhyme the weight the god the sign
The rom of don of spawn of khan, now whatchu doin' there khan?
Rap til I steal-her for-real illa with alligator blood veins
Me and a pisces hit the drug main
Eatin' on steak in the late night, tiger get your brain right
Dickey get the game tight, 'den fuck em all
Hear me once and you'll never forget
I'm like a caridagate, or better yet I got this ready to spit
Hot raps that burn and yearn fuck it you'll wait your turn
You'll get cut in line everytime
Man I live by the sword and die by the gun
And not give a fuck and why? 'cause I'm young
Raps that backtrack and crack the sky ask me why
Check if you deserve to die
Shit a Rip Van Winkel ebeneezer
Kill the plea ya kill the tea ya kill to ease the pain
That scarred the game on tiger's brain, sigh
Now that's a cold mother fucker, iced out.

What's that in your chain homie? Iced out.

To achieve my goals and make my dreams my reality
And what I got, I got killaz on a salary

So we bring the heat until the meat gets cooked

And everyday after that, for 8 months straight
We would roll tight, we had small fights
You shoulda seen how we argued under street lights
I couldn't see your tears, from the pouring rain
You shoulda seen my body shake, when she said my name
She said I'm not the same, Andre ya changed
I said baby its pain, from the rap game

Man I didn't even call, I went through withdrawal
Flashbacks of her face hit me sometime
And I be wonderin' man does she think of mine
I think of Rose
[Chorus: ]
Love is down through the hardest times
Sometimes I put Al Green on and think of Rose
Being with you is just a state of mind
Girl, thinking about you all the time
I saw her at a club, she was with a thug
She thought I would say hi, but I didn't show no love
The homey blazin' bud, and now its getting live
But I knew that she knew, that I'd protect my pride
I see her watchful eye, from across the joint
And then she knew how I feel, if I heard her voice
And some ladies talked, and other ladies walked
But when it came to you girl, man there was a spark
Your whole anatomy, man, was like poetry
The very smell of your hair was like luxury
It was because of me, when the days was bright
I would come through with my silent nights
Man, I think of Rose"

On my own like C-Lo
Got carried away
Married to this game when I eloped
Gone, imma take it further I'll learn her
Soon as I turn her out
And there'll be no doubt that she'll be flippin like a burger
Now I'm just a two-steppin, Hugh Heffin'
Gotta watch for these groupies pull flukies
just to get you naked
But imma a spit it, rap it
Til a young cat livin lavish
Your homeboy itch the scratch-it
I tell him get established, lean back
Trip off how they react
Nicky for strictly
Just for the sticky like the tree sap
Trixie got them
I let the beat blast time is money
Til then just miss me spit them lies Ta Dummies
Im genuine medicine, practice on my ettiquite
Represent the president Edison, feel to the elements (huh)
Your feelin trapped like a rat in a race
But slappin 5 cause a true rap cat in the place
Blow the purple, If not baby walk like Hershel
She can walk, run, long-jump, hurdle
Just leave the circle
Back on the blade after macin on stage
Don't hate cause I'm this
Tradin places wit me
Your livin days like a week
Every single toes on your feet
Gon' busy workin the streets
The co-co concrete
I got a plan it's get in and get out
And all my homies know what im talking about
Th-Th-Th-Thizz out
(Nickatina)
Man im classified a spitta in the game
I get the issue and the tissue
And don't cry about the fame
I spit a dart right through your heart
And see my life will come apart
I like to party in the dark
So baby how you gonna start?
The music's loud, I kick it live
and this is federal
So prime time
half the time you open wide
and my reflection's in your eyes
it's like the liquor on the counter
makin money by the hour
getting cleaner than a shower
standin out just like a flower
get the flavor for the fantasy
you know it's me I'm greedy
no more hidin in the clubs
because the bitches say they see me
I be chewin on the doublemint sometimes its spearmint
I say I got a bottom but the hoes aint hearin it
I talk a lot of shit man spit the mix
Mint flavor in this rhyme
""I seen you hella times but Nicky T your hard to find""
Freak I'm never in a hurry, rollin getting money
I can see it in your eyes you like to spit these lies Ta Dummies
Man even when I'm quiet you can see your boss talker
My new turn out she got some ??? in the walker
She's rare as a flyin sauca, so I'ts gonna cost ya
And if I neva had ya then I certainly neva lost ya
Your killin me, freak who you wanna be?
Holla at the G-O-D, hey Nicky T

Mics get hit from bullet flavor I spit
Change the clips and also do this shit
I be high as fuck when them MCs come
But from dawn to dusk I man break some up
Like booyow whatcha do now
I can hear them fools sayin loochow
From head to head
Dread to dread
Lead to lead
Spread the spread
Niggaz be trippin' when the indos gone
Niggaz be trippin' when they womans gone
Niggaz be trippin' when they moneys gone
Thats why I'm rapping on the microphone
Razor Sharp......Crack Raider
Time to build my juice back up
Like the curl of a finger in the Compton cuts
How many MCs do I have to kill
Before I get to the top of the hill
Camoflouge dodge and Pittsburg Black
Doing shows down the road where the niggaz be at
We spending food stamps
Avoid them tramps
A van full of beat with the Kenwood amps
Focus like a camera keep your eyes on the birdie
Legit as I can get but I still roll dirty
Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
crack raider raider razor... sharp... crack raider razor razor... sharp... crack raider...
A talka like me can't hit the block
Sucka MCs are like microphone cops
Jumped in the game for the do or die
Hit the microphone stand and got Kentucky Fried
Recognize baby that'll go for broke
Livin in the City run soley on coke
Razor sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp
Going about niiinneettyy
On the freeway choking
Ain't no mystery to the weed we smokin'
Andre Nickatina says show me some snaps
And Andre Nickatina will surely rap
I hate to be a whore but the World's a pimp
I'm trying to tell my niggaz man don't y'all simp
Coming like a Mack Truck miss me with the fat skunk
Represent the blunt when you get tossed up
Microphone flow like the Caddy at Ritz
At 9AM man the contact hits
Cocaine beats in stereo thinkin every car behind man is 5-0
Keepin all my rhymes on a computer chip
The Sugarhill Gang got me doing this
Razor... sharp....crack raider razor raider....sharp...sharp... crack raider sharp
Sharp

though angels guide me i seem to be lost
spittin a rhyme from devious ways
all in the veins them freaks they get paid
the path was layed the bed was set
nicky the cat from the fillmoe 'jects
here go the stealo it aint that odd
kahn, money, clothes, broads
don't forget weed and rap for the gods
pages that rewrite the holy quran
man i've been swervin since julius erving
ready to rap now so open the curtain
don't be in the lab when i'm doin bad
pencils and pads they turn to cash
this how i mash
driving so fast
shoes woo when i step on the gas
baby is mad
man she got ass
i looked and gave her my gangsta laugh
my pedigree my legacy
i sell it like aphetimines
they told me at the dinner scene
and i'm standing there high in my anchor jean
gangsta's, hustlers, hoe's and all
feel the pain when a rapper falls
blood in my hair from the wings of a hawk
though angels guide me i seem to be lost
its mighty extreme to being a king
looking for people to be on the team
how much money it cost to cheat
to slow ya down and be drug free
with kenneth cole boots and sean john suits
and execution that top of the roof
who got the juice
show me some proof
the curser the rhyme give me the loot
awake like an owl and drinkin some tea
watchin fights of muhamud ali
dodgin death with every step
this is my rep give me the checks
like snaggle puss i'll step to the left
with this freak death as quiet as kept
my philisophy is tha boss of me
pass the hot sauce to me
usin diamonds and pearls to flauce with me
i stand there with none
hot as a gun
the sound of the noise will make you run
move from the slugs that will rip your lungs
look in the eyes of the greediest god
rollin the streets with the cadi facade
cut through the rain like ninja blades
the batter ram explains the raid
i got my game from project floors
weed, dope, and dice by the door
crush anything that'll cause a threat
talk to the bookie secure the bet
never with leniency he won't agree with me
gettin all mad when i make the call
gangsta's, hustlas, hoes, and all
feel the pain when a rapper falls

In the blink of an eye
You know your tiga can die
I'm from the land of the 22, 44, 45
Riddles and lies is something we all despise
So we look up to sky for the answer to ""why?""
We was just little tigas when we first tried
You chose the d-game, and I chose the rhyme
Though our brains were the same man
Our brains had to change man
Cause if it didn't change, we'd be stuck in the game
Man the game
chorus:
(I can't even have a family god)
Fears of a coke lord driving my tigers insane
(These cats is coming after me god)
Tryin to get paid off the ya-yo powder and caine
(My woman's hella sheisty god)
Fears of a coke lord driving my tigers insane
(I wanna do better god)
But check it, I feel your pain
[verse two]
It was 7-4, I mean July the 4th
I was going on tour and you was going to war
Dope fiend checks, a new Lex and kill techs
Before I had to jet I told the god I'm impressed
He said check it out Nicky, I'm killing the world
My woman is top notch, got my brain in a twirl
Hella ballers done hit it and I call her my girl
And my mama looks at me like I'm not her pearl
I go to sleep every night with a body on my mind
Man, slugs from the nine, you shoulda seen how he died
Fears for years, but yo- you already knew that
I'ma keep selling dope, but yo, how can I do that?
Itchin to be vicious ever since I was seven
He said Nickatina will we go to heaven
For the game

Nicky:
I have to blink two times 'cause im camera shy
I dont eat ice cream or cherry pie
I make it melt man it'll be dripping of the shelf
But looking hella pretty like my leather buckle belt
Its a serenity a trinity
My legacy is begging me to change my identity
A four-five infinity
Anthology anatomy is sorta like a policy
A rapper termonology
It dont give an apology
You know the trigonometry
You think can handle flygirly (?)
It'd get the BDP
Half a crimonology
The mongoose bangs while the birds all sang
I wear my house shoes like Im part of a gang
Qupito:
I spread bread like mustard but never could trust her
You know im just a hustler caught up like Usher
Im all in trying to triple a nickel
See the game thats told get as cold as icicles
I cut 'em off if you question my analysis
Day i rate mayne my mind state mac a trick
Knowin all my homies gon call when ready
To the P.I's and those pushin raw like Eddy
You can give me a update and tell me ""wassup mayne""
Influxuate the paste till its cookie or cupcakes
Its so vivid straight up with no gimicks
Gotta get on her you can roll wit it
Every minute count we bounce
We count onces to the amount
Houses from the account breached up in the couch
Fly down south get the dough in atlanta
I hit the floor and do the Toni Montana
Chorus:
Im going to go, leaving clouds of smoke
Ima always do my bay thang,
Ima hustler mayne, gotta make my change
No time for playin games hey
State-to-State on a papa chase
Leavin em laced got moves to make
Im staying high like fly for life
Cant get by just to maintain
Quipto:
Oh hell naw
I aint done enough, theres more i gotta see
So lord dont punish me just 'cause i smoke alot of weed
Thats my apology see I be the no sinner
The rule breaker shaker mayne the goal tender
Getting the business suckas letting the cash burn
Im never finish not even after my last words
Natural disasters might take your boy
No doubt just let me go out in blaze a glory
Helpin kids cross the bridge it is what it is
Live life with a whole lot of sacrifice to give
I dont deserve it
Believe me if god told me its curtains
I hope i served my purpose and he knows I wasnt perfect
Young queez in this game for life
Translate do the damn till the day I die
Its a cold world baby and im already frost bit
So save your breath I play death when you talk shit
Nicky:
Man its the fifth wheel, some feel, roll up and blow kill
I dont trust them motherfuckers all of em hope still
Kay swiss white like columbian coke
And I dont care about your word I sell dreams and hopes
Man its the reece's buttercup be the focus like a mind reader
Number 2 pencil is Picasso's brush

The rush of the blood is like a task-force bust

Squat bounce drop dirty

HIt the freeway hard at night y'all
With the keys right there I'm ready to drive
Like a eagle at 12 I'm ready to fly
Pager going off, the cell phones ringin'
Al Green's playin' and I keep singin'
Jeans creased up with the beat up
Now I'm about to go pick this little freak up
Blow L's, make mail, ponytails
Had to compliment her on her fresh done nails
Varoom, motherfucker boom boom
A whole block of green lights, freak zoom zoom
Mario Andretti with Blowjob Betty
Pedal to the metal when your ridin' with the devil
Did just that at In-n-Out Burger
No pickles, no onions, no playin'
Check this out no delayin'
Did a donut right is what I'm sayin' SHIT
Police came, I was on the streets
Smokin' more weed, bumpin' more beats
Puttin' more words in the ear of this freak
Cadillac girl, somethin' I'ma keep, Seville?

At the HoneyComb Hideout, I'll find out, fishtailing where the hood chickens on the ride out

Push it man, don't be scared to squat
Custom fly ride with the perfect paint and the red light in you can't wait to race
[Mac Dre]
Cam, lifters, MSD shifters
Three fifty one make the old school swifter
Rap on the trunk, slap in the trunk
Fat four-four in my lap for the funk
Talkin' to a beezy on the phone but can't hear her
Turned down the hook, so I can hear clearer
I hear sireens get nearer
Red and blue lights in my rear view mirror
Pull over, nope nope
With a car full of smoke and trunk full of dope
I hit the gasser, go faster
All you hear is dual exhaust, flowmaster
On a chase, I take 'em, then I shake 'em
A real Cutthoat nigga ain't no fakin'
I shoot, ain't scared to scoot
And shake them one time on a hot pursuit"

Picture a blind man that can't see
Meaning the beauty he's supposed to see
God it can't be
I thizz alone like a snake, the venom I spit make me shake
Look at the cakes I baked
Weed in my brain got me baptized
Unless you talkin' bout money, you ain't sayin' shit rap wise
I'm so addicted to red licorice and fine bitches
Khan lives forever man that's my wishes
[Verse 2 - Equipto]
My wishes, we owe intense wishes
Bruce Lee, Tupac, and Jimmy Hendrix Peter Tosh
still here to leagalize it, with no police around to ever read they rights
It's how I roll, you know my lifestyle is cold
Around the globe, they treat us like Al Capone
Wish I didn't need a blunt in my mouth to blow
But I'm so far gone that's how it go
[Verse 3 - Andre Nickatina]
Yeah, two wishes and three bitches in the Cadillac
They wanna hit the club but this is where the party's at
Front line and in ya face like some gold teeth
My homie said he's like a butcher cause he loves beef
raw pipes and two doors on the cutty
I had to laugh at him, cause that's my buddy
We used to chase bitches so vicious it was delicious
I heard a lil' genie sayin ""Take more wishes""
[Verse 4 - Equipto]
Wishin', why listen to a fool really give a fuck
Don't interrupt you stupid you know I already hit the blunt
We get ta cuttin' like a DJ do
The game's sheisty like a NFL replay booth
In your backpack party with all my throwbacks on
Suckas stare like they're impressed, sayin ""Oh my god""
There go the whole bank wadd

I live like a Gipsy
Rap till I'm empty
Fly like a Frisbee
But hung like a Grizzly
You know, I blow
And there, I go
All on the freeway
Me and my queen mayne
I eats Gumbo
The jumbo
Shrimp combo
And when I clown, hoe
I smile like a criminal
I can be like Ecstasy
Show you a whole new recipe
Don't even know why you step to me
Sayin' you ain't impressed with me
I ain't trippin' darlin'
I hear my homies callin'
And when there's money involved
Man they despise stallin'
Hook it up and then cook it up
Man shook it up and then look it up
And rock it up and then chop it up
Man flock it up and then cop it up
I hit the underground trains(?) and thangs
Stood there rappin' till the rain done came
Till' the game done changed
Man I'ma get it mayne
And don't forget it mayne...
Shit, So greedy
Don't think that I can split it mayne
The Gingerbread Man
Catch me if you can
You back there... ""J'aibe soin d'un crayon""
Bartender, bartender... ""J'aibe soin d'un crayon""
Waitress, waitress... ""J'aibe soin d'un crayon""
You think I'm playin' baby? ... ""J'aibe soin d'un crayon""
Shit, shit...

then kick it parlay
Exchangin back to back rhymin

It cant wait for the hate n' feedback
I stat when I break down the weed on my rap
[Andre Nickatina]
I was born about eight miles from the City of Dope
Meanin my city is the City of Dope
weigh the coke, caddy spokes
it couldnt be saveed by John the Pope
Money is the bible couldnt care bout a idol
If youre goin for the title
then its kinda suicidle
'cause youre gonna have a rival thats bustin at ya do'
Tryin ta put bullet holes up in yo clothes
[Equipto]
oh, oh fo sho we can blow some mo'
while labels fall short ta tha ocean flo'
(suckas)
I get pesky boss like Joe Pesci
I drop hefty rhymes on all MC's
suckas that wanna play two cue execute
the play off loose I execute
on sight ya too height ya might get snatched
just like ya gold chain and no-name raps
[Andre Nickatina]
Homie dont ask me about that chick
because about any chick I'll plead the fifth
call me St. Nick when I spit the Gift
real rap cat on a pirate ship
lock n' chain like Sid Vicious
I done used my three wishes
When it comes ta swishers, cut the heart
Listinin' ta Al Green in the dark
Jumed in the ride with a letha' coat
looked in the rear view who popped the most
just when i thought that i saw a ghost
I realized it was the endo smoke
[Equipto]
ma gold rope i go fo' broke off green dope
ya last hope they shottin at me like the pope
i campaign the bang the vote is unanimous
smokin cannibis puttem in a camel clutch
like this cant trip when i get accross
set it off lay em down with no second thoughts
imposin' endo endulgin' keep blowin
Falcon and the snowman
[Nickatina]

had it with the new-improved police scanna'
hang the bannas' yo cock tha hammas'
or forever in life you'll wear a pampa'

It was pivotal when you came with pitiful answers
rhymes an avelanche in the average rapper
ya sweatin they goin all out representin'
ya in n out steppin like three five seven
i kept it honest promised no threatin'
ya probably flipped fo' if not fo-get it
I stepped in the house throw back with the peyton
excuse the food but ho back with the hey now
[Nickatina]
Check it, crack the bottle then crack the whip
yo hear i go a son down ill crack ya hip
i'm like an angel but at an angle
and then i start to talk like Marlin Brando
like that blow back in my croaka' sack
tell the benz dealer that the cadillac is back
outta turn from moonshine inta yak
and then the ATF wanna come raid the track
[Equipto]
I connive with mo drive ta multiply chedda'
I can see the fortune without the tella'
cock back the raw rap or release the classic
suckas a jaw-jap but i looked past it
I get detailed describe it graphic
practice the graph till im knowin it backwards
spit it with a passion one in the same
then i realease the masta and study the game
[Nickatina]
Ok, i hit the night sky with the ruby red eyes
the streets are hurtin i can hear her cry
freaks wear shoes thats not their size
and here come Nicky with the felony rhymes
and the melody crimes can ya crack the case
like a bat outta hell i start the race
scars on my face detect the hate
get a scale fo the rhyme when i push the weight."

How you gonna be a player with no girl?
shirly temples in the club, had a fight, now no curls.
if i gotta mack a dyke, rap a lie, give me the night that there freak im gonna get a peice of the pie, and wont cry.
Certain things make me shiver, like the coldest rap, when the money is delivered.

358004,july-the-4th,2007,andre-nickatina,Hip-Hop,"How should I start? I'm so confused
By now I'm sure you heard the news
Cats I got workin' on the block,
Got a plot for me to stop
In my heart, I can't even say they wrong
'cause in the game all the playas sing the same song
I have seen cats do back flips when the bullets hit
Had to go and bring Jesus in they life
Counterfeit to the pulpit
But anyway
I'm so loved and hated 'round the community
My mother wonder what money, drugs can do to me
I swear to God, I seen the Devil in my bag of weed
Where you live, I might freeze,
Gotta get this cheese
Cats is makin' side deals with these other dealers
And slappin' five with a player
Man, like I'm they nigga
I paged Nickatina, he didn't call me back
He must be on tour, but I'm not sure
But once again, it's July the 4th
And once again
God I'm goin' to war, for sure
""There's gonna be fighting,
And somebody's gonna get hurt, that's for sure""
.... ""And everything we worked for will be wiped out
And I don't think we can let that happen,
I mean that makes sense""
Man I taught these cats how to move this coke
Taught these cats about the weed they smoke
Took they mind from bein' broke
Now they wanna have me smoked?
My woman said to me, 'her or my friends?'
I said my friends 'cause we bowed our ends
She said, nigga please
Them muthafuckas is ya enemies
Baby I love you but I gots ta leave
Because you don't sleep
Some nights man, you don't even eat
Smokin' weed, nigga,
Runnin' the streets
But check it, I don't complain
I hate the fact her face is stuck in my brain
It's like razors just to hear her name
Put that on double glocks
The beef is burnin' every tick of the clock
Even the rain won't stop the plot
Got a page from Nickatina
But right when I was 'bout to call him back
My windshield had suddenly cracked,
from the impact
guage shotty, glass half cut off my body
I can recognize the shooter,
It was little Shotty
And I gave that muthafucka, yea his name,
He tryna' to take a cat out the game
Yo, I'm full of blood (?)
You know bullets give you hot love
I go in shock from the heat of the slug
I think I'm 'bout to die
This is my last time to testify
And after that there was no reply
Put that on double glocks (Shit)
""What did you say your name was again?""
""I didn't"""
358005,the-god-and-the-stripper,2007,andre-nickatina,Hip-Hop,"Wanna get married?
I never met a girl like you before
As I closed the Cadillac door
I said hi
She said hello, you're a handsome fellow
I said you're a pretty brown yellow
She start to laugh
She said im trying to catch a cab
Its crowded downtown and I got way too many bags
Her perfume had the whole block bumpin
Lady can I call you or somethin?
You're fine, no frontin
She said she was mendin a broken heart
Her last man had it, he ripped it apart
She had a mind like a scientist
Break it down the god the moon the earth the sun the guns
She said you can call me tonight, it's cool
I just have to work a little bit, no school
Man holla back
I watched her walk to the cab
She rolled down the window, blew a kiss then laughed
I gave a wave, thinking I wont see her for days
Three hours later yo, my celly phone rang
Now, watchu doing?
Man watchu doin, girl i'm thinking bout you
Girl I'm thinking bout you
Now what we gone do?
She said she's always busy, she's rarely home
And the last few days she's been so alone
I said yo we in the same boat
If we were singers on stage we'd be probably hittin the same note
She had a voice like an angel
And with a touch of game that'll make some cats never say no
I said we should sit and eat
Because I really ain't no telephone sex geek
Man I hit the streets
Then I found out she was a stripper and my mind just wouldn't let me call her back.

Reactions like a report card nigga all Fs

I cant remember the day
But i remember the night
The first time in my life had an mc fight
Caterpilla killa lyrics spit like venom
Only thang my mind said was nigga go and get em
I ducked and bust and started cussing at them maggots
Niggas started pulling fresh rhymes out the cabinet
My flow got quicker like machine gun Killa
Some mc's got hit even tho they werent ready
Watch me wrap you up like a boa constrictor
And pose like a pimp in your girls prom pictcha'
I watch mc's die like soldiers in war
Everybody for them self so there aint no score
This niggas was bust a verse that he didnt rehearse
And got snatched from the earth like an old lady purse
The freestyle had mothafuckas on their backs
But felt the attack from the gangsta rap
Last breath of an MC
I hit the weed like a champ as i let raps fly
And best beleive when i die man in my mind i'll be high
I saw old mc's that had a wounded bad
And if i slipped I could tell they would take they chance
So like rambo 1
Man i drew first blood
And hit em in the neck with 2 rap slugs
Mc's brought gats and bats one had an axe
Before he took a swack man i got him in the back
With pimp game rhyme
The moneys all mines
12 o'clock midnight me and him bond
Mc females they slipped in and heard
Before they got close MAN i put em on the curb
With 'em lookin
You see my vocal box start cookin
Screams where heard from frisco down to brooklyn
I dont do it for the fun 'cause ima mc rival
Fuck if you a champion
I dont want your title
LAST breath of an mc
Feel me
A 12 gauge stage displayed wit all rage
Bet yo last dolla it will make front page
It lasted all night, Mcs filled the block
Some dead with they eyes open rap shellshocked
Hip hop was left handed
He packed 2 gats
Just incase he ran in the gangsta rap
Bodies lay some hurt
Still trying to get away
But if they get away
They will return anotha day
But i kill em
Hit em with just enough venom
Eyes wide open until the cops come and get em
I pause, my dialogue 'ttampt to catch my breath
But before i knew it a rhyme had penetrated my vest
Caught off gaurd by an mc flow oh no
My mind start to click like a black 4 4
Rapid repeated rhymes that went for his throat
And after he died i spit raps at his ghost
Man im hurt i can see the cops start to lurk
I hit one with a rap that had 'em squirmin' in the dirt
I start to Hurl
I think about my old girl
Baby u had the best pussy in the world
I felt my heart start TO collapse
Ima hate to leave the game like that
I felt another rhyme dig deep into my spine
Just when i was about to hit a pig with another line
I'll see ya next time

Bumping' Shabba Ranks on a full tank

Phat farm sweatas, DMC leather and shootin' my mouth off like a beretta
[Chorus x2]
Pretty bartender, can I get another shot of that Heem
She was tall enough to make a ball team
She said she neva met me it was like a pipe dream
I moved through the crowd yo and neva got seen
Then I sat down on a white couch, made it all official
It's poppin like a pistol and a missile
A picnic basket, man call me Yogi Berra
Man Andre Nickatina from the Ronald Reagan era.

I put that on the rhyme, the line, the crime and everything I do in time
Mutha fucka get outta line
Everybody gonna shine if you work that ass you fine
You can make my money stack
Do it back-to-back
Tell your girlfriend it ain't an act
If she really wanna go in the back
It's like the Olympics man she can hit the track
On the prowl just like a cat lookin' for the scratch
I think that you get the catch
This ain't no (?) match

You's a supa dupa brown bitch
You top heavy and round thick
I have to crank the bass in my Crown Vic
Then drop you off so you can strip
Man the money it rains, it pours
Open up the doors
You get V.I.P galore
When it comes to my pimpin' I'll tell you more
You eat all up like a candy store
Hershey bars and Kit Kats
So that's why I love when you bring it back
And you's an Almond Joy eatin' all the boys
Showin' other freaks, ya, how to work a toy
And, man, just like a chocolate cake when you start to bake
Man I think about the money you make
And the look up on your face
When you see me in the building and I come in and blast the place
Walked up like (?)
I walk around like the president and I don't leave no evidence
Cause at the end of this night bitch I'm a (?)
And she smiled like the Cheshire cat lookin like China statue
Man it was super stacked
Man she worked the tricks for super scratch
And she talked them outta super rack

Gimme five minutes and I'll turn you out
You's a money makin red bone that brang all your bread home
Five foot nine and dead on
Them heels put you in a six zone
Packin' all kinds of bakery
This is a bitch that's meant for me
Shake what your mama gave to me
Bitch 'member when you said you wouldn't pay me?
Now everything you got I got
Believe me bitch you make a lot
Ballin' getting me precious rocks
Every Parlor at the shop
Getcha hair done and I'm sprung
You get more money at the club
Perm it hard, and curl it up
Shake it down and shake it up"

And when it comes to me
Like all y'all want something from me
I got the pimps, the pushers, players, all the junkies screamin
Cause if they have no Money baby then they start to feenin'
I'm at the gamble shack
Sometimes they put me in the back
Sometimes the D boys put me where all the guns and all they dope is at
I'm in your pockets, wallets, purses all your hideaways
I'm probly the root of everybody's very violent ways
(Let me hold you)
(Let me hold you)
Yo, ask Obama he say straight up,
""Yo, I know that Money.
He's in my pocket and I dare you try to take him from me""
I know the Mafia
They love me and they treat me well
Man, they be askin for me even when they go to jail
I'm in the drug game so I know about them drug sales
And I be all on Wall Street so I know like when your stock fails
Some call me ""Cash Flow"" and I dig it like a bad ho
(Let me hold you. Let me hold you
This is what they say
(Let me hold you. Let me hold you)
Every single day
(Let me hold you. Let me hold you)
In a religious type of way
(Let me hold you. Let me hold you)
Let me touch you, let me hold ya, something
I'm at the crap table and some might say a dice game
And when it comes to me people will like argue kill and fight mane
They call me Ben Franklin, Benjamin and Young Benji
They call me Blood Money yo when the gangsters come and get me
They like to bury me and carry me in armored trucks
And just the other day man some kid said
""I'm strictly guaped up""
And all the politicians like to give me to they mistress
And all the broke bitches mention me in all they wishes
(Let me hold you)
(Let me hold you)
They make me rain at strip clubs like the weathers bad
And some might ask for more of me if your credits bad
Some spend me real fast man, like they know I won't last
And some like to put me away in big old Hefty garbage bags
Some call me Cheddar Cheese and they'll die for me you best believe
And they don't want me from Mickey D's
They wanna get me out this freak
I'm nothing cheap you need to hear it and believe that

When people have me they tell other people that they ballin'
And all the strippers tell they boyfriends
""Hey yo, Money's callin! ""
I'm all in Vegas I'm the number one priority
And I know every president so don't make me show authority
I know the coc dealers familiar with life pushing keys
And one name was Montana and he stacked up a lot of me
I'm all in bank vaults if I'm lost it's they fault
And I like all the pretty women that like to tell men what they cost
(Let me hold you)
(Let me hold you)
Some like to steal me, yo and lie to people that they did it
And even on they death bed they just won't admit it
You can't take me with you
Here's the issue
I'll forget you
And depending on how much you had of me that is why people miss you
They call Money mane you can mix me up with that honey mane
And anyone can be a boss but bosses know I'm running things
That's why all bums be thinking that I'm spare change

This is what they say

358015,9-to-5,2010,andre-nickatina,Hip-Hop,"Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once in a city suite
14 introduced to the streets
Started from weed, big smoke outs
before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
playin it the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
you see the big girls do it so of
course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blow in ya time
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Chompin and compin kicks some blind people with they fits
Where you fit?
Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
not too much 'cause you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat in the pack in the sock
take a couple of tubes, then its back to the block
Back to the service out the sack
experimentin with that salt, what about that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
papered out, always at the Potter house
Day time, night time, nigga part it out
couldn't been a papered up power house
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Like you and I, super high, like superfly
one more line, one more rhyme like groovy and fine
I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? like boston george,
you want some more, for you and your whores
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
and corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man, high, eight balls and quarters
they call me, placin they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the cake
before I'm sold, they take the taste
Snortin, have it, not with affordin
some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doin my job, connected wit the mob
got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal
I must have been craze yo
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal

358016,tony-montana,2010,andre-nickatina,Hip-Hop,"[Chorus: x2]
This girl said I act like Tony Montana
When it comes to her I just can't forget the camera
Thick bitch but I really can't stand her
Somebody put on the new Jacka
Prime time
It all started with a fine dime
She make it warm in the winter time
But my heart is so cold from the wrath of the city streets
We might meet but we don't speak
Man I'm a 24/7 rap cat
Hair stay permed in a baseball cap
I slither through the town like a cobra snake man
The money she make be the money I take
I hit the bay bridge
NASCAR style
I drive so fast
Weed in my head
Foot on the gas
I look her in the eyes
But she already lookin' at me
She say Nicky-T I wanna be
[Chorus x2]
Let's go
It's like I just won the Lotto
From tennis shoes to high heels is my motto
I got her a iPhone not a Metro
And once again we on the road baby let's go
Picture every image at the line of scrimmage
And all the clothes and the money that might diminish
And while the wheels just spin on the luxury car
The ho be sippin that workin at the luxury bar
Prime time
It all starts with a fine dime
And even on a bad day yo she still shine
Man it's amazing how she keep her waistline
The type of body that make a car run a stop sign
I float like a butterfly
I spit a fly lullaby
Wear fly shades when I'm high
You can hit me when the money is froze
About time you touch down it should still be cold
[Chorus x2]
The world is mines
And that ain't no lie
Damn girl, you really like a dime
Your little red corvette that you be dippin solo
I'm your best friend and your Manolo
I ride through Coconut Grove
Lookin' for you
Where could you be
Are you hidin from me
I'm a junkie about the ends
And it's a cold dark night and I'm dippin the benz
With a blunt close to the window
Where did you go
All in the back of my mind I know
All the bread that she made for me
Man it's not gonna be there it's plain to see man

Don't worry about the paper
I can manage you precisely
My heart might be cold but the ism kinda icy
You got it goin' on now do I have to shake something?
She with her home girl so I don't' have to say nothin'
I campaign everything
Yeah I like to floss
I never shop at Ross and yo I never check the cost
She comin through the door man I think chosen up
In all the City blazed you might see me cruisin' up

Being outta pocket is not about that
Six foot money maker I'm glad I found that
A Choosey Susie and I'm glad I clowned that
Man I really like to maximize
And somebody flies to collect the prize
And always looking for the best to buy
And clients old as Bob Barker
Nerdy like Peter Parker
Supa dupa bad when the money unfold
I let that bitch buy my clothes, my wife beaters my cologne
No new trick can take you home
I don't care if it's Al Capone
Flip the chips and flip the tricks
Then call another on the phone
Break it down like Indica
Man they all gonna wanna be a friend of ya
But makin' sure that they spending ya
Don't be telling people man that's kin to ya, shit
And do it man like a Kobe shot
Man it's my team winnin you like it or not

I bundle up for the night air
Even though its cold and dark yo i still wear white Nike Airs
I cop like 4 pairs
It reminds me of Michigan and Antwan Jobear
I hit the night like I'm el presidentay
Don't wanna be up in the kizer perementay yo
And I rush outta town like Picasso I rap pain
A perfect picture yo
Then I come right back
Then I embrace my criminal mind, a criminal kind
Heres your chance if you see a criminal shine
Cuz my style is real 'Pac yo with the Pun set
A lotta Tuxedos before I gotta jet
I like breakfast in the nighttime
MGA made a clock man its fight time
Man this the life of a blind genius
And even though I can see let me tell you what I mean is
I'm so blind by material things
Yeah sometimes I dont see whats in front of me mane
Yeah ya heard right
I hit the night life
And shake the whole scene up like a pair of dice
I tell the bartender thats too much ice
And she overchargin on the hennessy price
I dont freestyle
I dont free lance
I said paced out
I say pay fast
I know homies that passed in the weight class
But it was pushin weight that they all passed at
And when i gamble dont catch me on a bad day
Like when the warriors had just lost the other day
You send me to a preacher
I confess
You said its all good
I said lets bet
I think of Khan at the crack of dawn
And then I hit my closet for a new sean John
Im in the middle of a premier pack
I put vocals in the burgandy 'lac
Yo my perm is like jet black
Man its the life of a blind soul
Its like a hustla tryna sell you fake gold
Or like a married man who aint never faithful
Or talk down on a ?? when he break hos
(CHORUS)
I hit my court date smellin like straight weed
Plus I had a fat knot in my blue jeans
You might have to pray for me when I hit Vegas because my mind is wrapped up in the latest and the greatest
My afrodesiach is the payest
Never to play us or delay us
And everyone that know me homie know I gotta shopping fetish
If you think Im buyin you somethin you best forget it
Backwards like benjamin button
Or superbad somethin like McLovin
Hotter than the oven
Baby that boils the crack
And When it comes to rap
I'm like a spoiled brat
And you can catch me some days, hair oiled back
And countin on somethin thats a royal stack
At the tuxedo party in royal black
They had barbeque I said foil that

And I don't have to time to be no sponsor
Man and if we do it right then we might have time to hit up all the concerts
Might hit the mall way harder then a boxer
Do something nice
Then he asking me to knock her
I could never jock her
Gotta put the game on display
She bit her lip and didn't walk away
My name is Dre!
Verse #2
Baby make that flight
For real, We could do it all tonight
Now give me one chance to make it right
Cause' I could get the clients
And you can get the science
The way I'm talking baby, can make somebody else buy it
They really can't deny it
The city is the maker for the money
Blaze no, dirty talk to me
My number is 555-5555
It's kind of hard to memorize
I'm so live
I do a U-Turn all on Vaness
Baby thought I wouldn't do it cause' the car is so fresh
I jump out the car
Own her like a shooting start
And even though I wearing Jordan man I still at the par
Man its the city life with the pretty life
When people treat their car and they money like a pretty wife
You take her round town maybe take her downtown
Anywhere the moneys quick and it never slows down."

Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell
Another tale about that yayo
Little girl once in a city suite
14 introduced to the streets
Started from weed, big smoke outs
before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth
Sham, Nay, blew you blew
now you need something else to do
A new high to try, a new place to go
introduced to the yay to the yo
House full of girls, old and young
playin it the table takin one on ones
Use dollar bills just to snort the lines
you see the big girls do it so of
course it's fine
Cocaine enforced on your mind
Now blow, then they blow in ya time
(Chorus 2X)

Let's go-
Ayo for yayo
Walk around with yayo, all in my naso
I must have been crazo
(San Quinn)
Chompin and compin kicks some blind people with they fits
Where you fit?
Fillmore Street is where you sit
Don't go in the house till you move a zip
Worked a day and night shift
To stay awake, a nigga might sniff
not too much 'cause you might slip
Instead of 28, you cookin 26
Keep a gat in the pack in the sock
take a couple of tubes, then its back to the block
Back to the service out the sack
experimentin with that salt, what about that crack, huh?
One try, another try without a doubt
papered out, always at the Potter house
Day time, night time, nigga part it out
couldn't been a papered up power house
(Chorus 2X)

I can keep you down, and get you high
You like to blow? like boston george, you want some more, for you and your whores
I kick off wars, and get behind walls
and corporate doors, executive nose sore
Rich man, high, eight balls and quarters
they call me, placin they orders
Bring me across the border, buyin the cake
before I'm sold, they take the taste
Snortin, have it, not with affordin
some use me, strictly out of boredom
I hooked people before man, I warned them
I took many people out before them
Doin my job, connected wit the mob
got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob
Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night

Talkin' to another brother, givin' me the eye
Man I can't believe those thighs, shit
I can see the freakin your eyes, shit
And if I get you in my coils), I'ma strike for oil
And let me tell you baby girl I'm spoiled
My favorite colour's blue, I'm like the number two
Meanin' that I like to have my cake 'n eat it too
She said, ""Do you want a drink Nicky baby?"" -""Yeah""
""You want me to get it for you baby?""

I'm only in town for one day, what up
Aretha Franklin tapes I like to play, what up
I can see you like the Tanqueray
Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, fast
I'm lookin' like MC Shan, flash
Baby is at least a six footer, ass
We can get together in the middle of the night
Hop into my ride, take flight, that's right
You're rollin' with a pisces, buckle up tight
Slick Rick talkin' like, ""da da da...""
Straight chicken hawkin' like, ""da da da...""
Caught up in my game like, ""da da da...""

Feelin' kinda tipsy man but I ain't really trippin'
Talkin' bout the next expedition
Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre (what up)

You're mines
Girl what's your zodiac sign?
You're mines
All up in my eyes, you a dime
You're mines
And I'ma keep on spittin' baby only if you're listenin'
Standin' in the gangsta position

We can keep talkin' in the cuts, what up
Damn girl ya got a big butt
Shit- My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre, fo' real

And plus rhyme pays like, ""da da da...""
And I really ain't ashamed like, ""da da da...""
My name is Nicky, but you can call me Dre
The plan is to talk to ya girl until you understand
The plan, we can talk about your pants 'cause I really don't dance
Standin' in my playboy stance
I look you in the eye, you're rubbin' on my hands
I know you got a man, ya actin' so bold
That's why the game might be feelin' so cold
I say you got control, I put you in the hole
I tell you in your ear, ""Do you wanna roll?""

Early one morning with a freaky ho* tapped on her shoulder said lets go
She turned around and said oh no
Imma start bloating like benicio
Early one morning with a freaky dame
A different broad but its all the same
She said she know how to f*ck and I'm to blame
Woulda said something back but forgot her name
Games gonn come and get you
Bring the camera with you
The photographer with the nudey pictures
A little old trick from my boy pat rich
She said I ain't no groupie ho*
I said see E. Already knows
Girls want to try and act straight and square
But super freaks in their underwear
Walken just like Christopher
Tossin to get rid of her
Smoov is the way I act
And like Jackpot I'm a play boy Mack
Back to the first night it was Hennessy
On the second it was just you and me
The third my vision was blurred
I don't recall understanding a word
Panties hanging from the light fixture
She stare all day at my yearbook picture
Whispers right off my shoulder
My spit gets raw as my age gets older
Flousey is what you are
Doobie smoke broke out my car
Spit this game like a moccasin
Get this broad then floss again
Early one morning with a freaky ho* she turned around and said oh no
I need to get to Sebastopol
Early one morning with a freaky dame
A different broad but its all the same
She said she know how to f*ck and I'm to blame
Woulda said something back but forgot her name
E's gonn smoke heavily breathe deep till your lungs bleed
Ooh I don't run in the game
But gangsta when I do my thang
Change like a dollar bill
Strange tell you how to feel
Tame but it's so real
Keep my ho*s rotating like a steering wheel
It's like crazy when you look at me
It's like baby who you trying to be
Lazy when you hit the weed
It's a whole nother story when you're hanging with E.
Keep her brain on spin like a ceiling fan
Keep my donkey swole it's supply in demand
Gotta be the man get to spittin
Try another broad out, don't know what you're missin
Got a whole notebook full of game, game
Got a roladex full of b*tches, b*tches
Got a big black book full of names, names
If I showed it to you you'd think its vicious, vicious
Got a whole clipboard full of game
And a big black book where you can write your name
They all the same but know what I'm about
And ready for whatever E dish out
Some ho*s think we made from mud
But I know its muscle and blood
Grab your piece like nick and pack it quick
Got a call from my b*tch gotta give
I'm the big jimmy D. sausage King
Like frank white so much heat to bring
I want a bad b*tch with no limitations
I'm a big bad wolf when it comes to relations
Mouthpiece like this you know I score
""Sixteen tons"" like Ernie Ford
I pop like a mule, hit like a bat
Nothing like listening to that gangsta rap
I flow so smooth call me water vore
She f*ck so good see I taught her boy
It only took a few lines for me to bag it
I bet you didn't know I'm a p*ssy addict
It's a good thing I got groupies to catch
That'll make p*ssy gum or p*ssy patch

By now I'm sure you heard the news
Cats I got workin' on the block,
Got a plot for me to stop
In my heart, I can't even say they wrong
'cause in the game all the playas sing the same song
I have seen cats do back flips when the bullets hit
Had to go and bring Jesus in they life
Counterfeit to the pulpit
But anyway
I'm so loved and hated 'round the community
My mother wonder what money, drugs can do to me
I swear to God, I seen the Devil in my bag of weed
Where you live, I might freeze,
Gotta get this cheese
Cats is makin' side deals with these other dealers
And slappin' five with a player
Man, like I'm they nigga
I paged Nickatina, he didn't call me back
He must be on tour, but I'm not sure
But once again, it's July the 4th
And once again
God I'm goin' to war, for sure
'There's gonna be fighting,
And somebody's gonna get hurt, that's for sure'
.... 'And everything we worked for will be wiped out
And I don't think we can let that happen,
I mean that makes sense'
Man I taught these cats how to move this coke
Taught these cats about the weed they smoke
Took they mind from bein' broke
Now they wanna have me smoked?
My woman said to me, 'her or my friends?'
I said my friends 'cause we bowed our ends
She said, nigga please
Them muthaf**kas is ya enemies
Baby I love you but I gots ta leave
Because you don't sleep
Some nights man, you don't even eat
Smokin' weed, nigga,
Runnin' the streets
But check it, I don't complain
I hate the fact her face is stuck in my brain
It's like razors just to hear her name
Put that on double glocks
The beef is burnin' every tick of the clock
Even the rain won't stop the plot
Got a page from Nickatina
But right when I was 'bout to call him back
My windshield had suddenly cracked,
from the impact
Gave shotty, glass half cut off my body
I can recognize the shooter,
It was little Shotty
And I gave that muthaf**ka, yea his name,
He tryna' to take a cat out the game
Yo, I'm full of blood (?)
You know bullets give you hot love
I go in shock from the heat of the slug
I think I'm 'bout to die
This is my last time to testify
And after that there was no reply
Put that on double glocks (Shit)
'What did you say your name was again?'
'I didn't'"

Jeans creased up with the beat up
Now I'm about to go pick this little freak up
Blow L's, make mail, ponytails
Had to compliment her on her fresh done nails

No pickles, no onions, no playin'
Check this out no delayin'
Did a donut right is what I'm sayin' SHIT

Turned down the bump, so I can hear clearer
I hear sirens get nearer
Red and blue lights in my rear view mirror
Pull over, nope nope
With a car full of smoke and trunk full of dope
I hit the gasser, go faster
All you hear is dual exhaust, flowmaster
On a chase, I take 'em, then I shake 'em

Sometimes I do what my momma do

Respect the name
State your claim'

Holy Con'ver adjust your rhyme bookin' by the dollar imma be a scholar
Clouds start to gather around, Tennasee tears on that clown
Focused like a falcon scoutin on the hideout in the mountains

Just like a bat out the hottest hell
Mixin' pink bunny when the jewelry sell
Do it again when I make bail
You know the streets a hard drive
Everyday a newer crime
Caught up in the wrong design
Watch your heart just flatline
Shake it like the earthquake does
Nothin but steel inside your blood
Colder than a winter storm
Some will die and some are born
But do it all- you miss, remain
Full respect for this here game
Forget your unbrella mang
And take a ride with me in the rains
Come and wash away the pain
'Cause they dun taste my tears
'Cause I've been cryin fo years
Conversation they cutthroat
Deaths of sangs on every note
Tell the truth on every quote
'Cause mothafuckas come up short
Actin' like this is Hollywood
In the real world and it hardly good
Talkin' like ya you don't care
End up in a wheelchair
Livin' witcho mama while yo friends in the bahamas
And sanas

he wants to pay his toll
but don't know how
Blind man dreams
whispering your name
anwer if he calls
Blind man dreams
wipe his teardrops
catch him if he falls
Trying hard to see through your eyes
it blures his vision when he tries
no one to hold on to
while sleeping tight
Absentminded when he speeks
his tainted body feels so week
he dozes off again
and starts to dream
Blind man dreams
whispering your name
answer if he calls
Blind man dreams
wipe his teardrops
catch him if he falls"

I never ment a word of it
Now I'm searching for those words

condemnting me
just pulling me back down
into the darkness of my fragile mind
here tonight
I feel the beating of my heart

Stay with them this time
try hard to
stay with them this time
and try not to believe
that we're entwined in misery
The awful sense of hoplessness
is something that we'll have to
try to forget
It seems so barren to consume
we need a change or this is something
we will regret
Stay with them this time

stay with them this time

everybody's waiting for the man to fall
but could this be another strange disease
conceived illusions?
On and on and on it goes
still we don't know
where to go to
Scattered in my heart
words they fall apart
like feelings without trust
like leaves that turns to dust
To seek the everlasting remedy
seems to be the human tragedy
to forget the reasons that he told
instead of trying hard not to withhold
Trapped inside a world of broken glass
it's getting harder every day to pass
soon we will be gone and he will say
""I tried to stop them""

my fading world in grey

discarding all I knew
when this smiling girl with plastic flowers
told me what to do
I love to cry
when her tension holds me down
when I'm imprisoned by her soft words
controlled in every move
how I love to cry
She taught me how to live
enslaved me by her side
like a little boy in a concrete dream
she took me for a ride
I lost my sense of time
as her illusions changed my past
my image broke when she touched my mind
and I knew it had to last
I love to cry
when her tension holds me down
when I'm imprisoned by her soft words
controlled in every move

Fading away
in the darkest night
she's a shade of hear youth
Standing there in the dark
all is real but still unseen
she looks around with a sign of grief
She needs someone who cares
someone who listens to
those words of disbelief
Fading away

Fading away
in the darkest night
she's a shade of hear youth

breeding disease an aching shame
It doesn't matter how I try
I don't know why
I really do deplore
my simple minded words
still I don't know why you act this way
You often criticized
but never realized
nothing about this matter was my fault
Every day just feels the same
breeding disease an aching shame
it doesn't matter how I try
I don't know why
Trying so hard
to watch my own mistakes

the way you feel when you see them fall
wallowing in pain
like flowers in the heavy rain
I hear hypnotising words
propaganda spreading nationwide
implanted and concealed, once more
It's time to say goodbye
no need to digify
when there's so much more to say
before they go away
In this shapeless world of ours
were culprits teach the playing girls
nothing is sincere
trust replaced by fear
I see the madness of our times
within the sample of the young boys blood
unity split in two, and on
It's time to say goodbye
no need to dignify
when there's so much more to say
before they go away"

The sun is hiding
when darkness fills the skies
The boys are so young

I hear their president speaking
a whole nation he deceives
But I am not the one who cries
CHORUS
It's time to go
the other side is calling
It's time to leave
everything behind
The wounds are growing
in a nation full of hate
No sight of solutions
in a deeply polluted state
Foreign leaders trying hard
to rule the game
But what can they do
when there is no-one to blame
But I am not the one who cries

I still wonder what to accept

looking at me with a smile on her face
CHORUS
Watching you
standing in the dim light
Watching you
hiding in the dark night
Watching you
while the rain is falling
(It's a hard rain)
You should know the way I feel
it's not easy to reveal
words of love or words of pain
kept inside my heart

that there is something incorrect

It still relates the fact, that I
Am lost in this peculiar dream
Your expressions make my scene
You entertain me
Every night and day, my life
Is built upon your secret smiles
I 'm speechless when you
Save me save me from myself
Sweet inspiration changed my wretched thoughts
Save me save me from myself
Sweet motivation in the words you brought
Transparent words
Enfolds my disbelief, your voice
Illuminates my doubtfullness
You 've changed me more or less
It feels so good to hear you
Spell my name, so soft
Are all those words you aim at me
Apparently you
Save me save me from myself
Sweet inspiration changed my wretched thoughts
Save me save me from myself
Sweet motivation in the words you brought"

when nighttime falls
we're here to stay with you
until the morning dew
Reject those images they brought you
forget those heartaches the gave you
Once upon a time there was
something good and something strong
although it sometimes might seem wrong
we must once more return to dust
Reject those images they brought you
forget those heartaches they gave you"

standing alone with frozen feet
A car drives up, a window goes down
she looks at a stranger with a smile on her face
She knows what he wants, he knows what she is
there's no need to talk, just a silent kiss
The car drives away, the window goes up
she starts to please the man beside her
Skillful hands all over his body
trying to forget while she's going her work
The lonly soul now controlled by a stranger
the little girl doesn't know she's in danger
CHORUS
A cheap girl in a modern world
a cheap girl in a modern world
she's a cheap girl in a modern world
with hopefull dreams in a world where no-one cares
After a while the man starts to beat her
she tries to get out, but she's caught inside
It doesn't take long before it is over
and another name is written in blood
She was a little girl with dreams made of pure gold
little girl just fifteen years old

a cheap girl in a modern world
she's a cheap girl in a modern world

they had no choice
they could not stay this time
They tried so hard to preserve
the world they knew
to hard to hold their line
I fear that innocence
has lost it's way this time
There's no future in the past
I know that now
we have to percieve our hate
And it's to late to change events
life is a matter of sense
redemtion comes to he who waits
I fear that innocence
has lost it's way this time
It hurts
when you try
to remember"
358070,words-without-meening,2006,elegant-machinery,Pop,"I hear those vioces repeating themselves
with words I've heard before
They're trying hard to break me down
while they are reaching out for more
I feel they're hands pushing all over
with a stronger hold on me
How I wish I could explain to them
what it really makes me feel
CHORUS
I've got to get away
it's getting hard to stay here
I've got my own life now
no matter what they say
They took me apart but they didn't care
if they brought me back again
It took me far to long to realise
that my efforts were in vain
I need some time to tear these walls down
to rebuild whats left of me
When I find the strength I'm searching for
I will break their hold on me

Hold me tight and whisper what you wish
For there is no one here around
Oh you may sing song me sweet smiles
Regardless of the city's careless frown
Come watch the no colors fade blazing
Into pedal sprays of Violets of Dawn
In blindful wonderments enchantments
You can lift my wings softly to fly
Your eyes are like swift fingers reaching out
Into the pockets of my night
Whirling twirling puppy warm before the flashing cloaks of darkness
gone
Come see the no colors fade blazing
Into pedal sprays of Violets of Dawn
Some prince charming I'll be
On Two white steeds to bring you diamond crowns
And climb your tower sleeping beauty
Before you ever know I've left the ground
You can wear a Cinderella Snowhite Alice Wonderland gown
Come watch the no colors fade blazing
Into pedal sprays of Violets of Dawn
But if I seem to wander off in dream like looks
Please let me settle slowly
It's only me just staring out at you
A seeming stranger speaking holy
I don't mean to wake you up it's only lonliness just coming on
So let the no colors fade blazing into petal sprays
Of Violets Of Dawn
Like shadows bursting into mist
Behind the echoes of this nonsense song
It's just chacing whispering trail
Of secret steps see them laughing on
There's magic in the sleepiness of waking to a childish sounding yawn
Come watch the no colors fade blazing
Into pedal sprays of Violets of Dawn"

they would fight till the dark

and happy lives that were not saved
no one could escape
from the fire and the flames

we were searching for the answer
but got flooded by the rain
in a moment what goes out
got possesed by heavy rain
they all went insane...

they were bind by the fire
leaving ashes on our walls
setting fire to the dark
running forward
sinking backwards
singing sorrow on our hands
could never reach our destiny

I don't want to go out on the town
I don't want to watch TV together
I just want to kiss you on the mouth
We don't have to spend a lot of money
We don't need to get up off this couch
I just want to turn the lights down honey
And kiss you on the mouth
I wanna get drunk on your lips like wine
Get lost in you a thousand times
Baby while you're here with me tonight
I don't want to think about tomorrow
I don't need to think about that now
I don't want to ask where this is going
I just want to kiss you on the mouth
I want to pull your body close to mine
I don't know why we're wasting time
Cause baby it's just you and me tonight
I don't want to talk about the weather
I don't want to go out on the town
I don't want to watch TV together
I just want to kiss you on the mouth
I think I could stay like this forever
Baby this is what life's all about
Let me show you how to make it better
Let me kiss you on the mouth
I just wanna kiss you on the mouth"

Looking at me tonight
In a brand new light
What a surprise
Was a time when I would have given anything
For you to look at me this way
But as your friend I've got to say
Maybe we should wait
When you say you're over her
I want to believe it
But we both know it's
[Chorus:]
Only the lonely talkin'
Wanting
Me to keep on holding you this way
Baby
You know I want to
But I've got to be sure
It's not only the lonely talkin'
It would be easy for me
To lie in your arms tonight
Oh but in the morning light
Would it be right
'Cause I want all of you
Not just a part of you
So tell me is it
[Chorus:]
Baby we've got time
To make this thing right
But right here, right now
Tonight...it's

And we're all heading down to Mojo's club
We got the night a rollin'
All rough and ready for some fun
The band starts around 10:30 but that ain't early enough
[Chorus:]
I just wanna have a good time
Drink the week off my mind
With all my friends on Friday night
No talkin' politicians, no talkin' religion
Forget about our crazy lives
Get out and do it right
And have a real good honky-tonk time
It's wall to wall in this old bar
With a beer in hand and double shots are up
As fiddle and the steel guitar fill the air
We're kickin' up the dust
Tonight ain't about tomorrow when we'll all be feeling pretty rough
I just wanna have a good time
Drink the week off my mind
With all my friends on Friday night
Cause a commotion, feel the music in motion
Have the time of our lives
Get out and do it right
And have a real good honky-tonk time
Come closing time when lights come up
We're gonna wanna stay and think man
What's the fuss
I just wanna have a good time
Drink the week off my mind
I just wanna have a good time
Drink the week off my mind
With all my friends on Friday night
We'll follow intuition, making not prediction
No end in sight tonight
Get out and do it right
And have a real good honky-tonk time
A real good honky-tonk time"

Why I woke up this morning only heaven knows
Spilled my cup of coffee and I burnt my toast
Can't find the keys 'cause they're locked in my car
Just look at me baby I'm falling apart

I remember the moment you looked in my eyes
You said that you loved me, then you said goodbye
Oh and right then and there is where I lost my spark
Now look at me baby I'm falling apart
Just look at me baby
I'm trying to be strong
But I need some time
Gotta get myself together
I've made up my mind
But how do I move on when I don't know where to start
Just look at me baby I'm falling apart

You said that you loved me, then you said goodbye
Oh it cut me so deep that it hit me real hard

That Jesus forgives you
You pray I will, but I won't
The difference is
Jesus loves you, I don't
I know it sounds cruel
And it's really not like me, but
You've put me in a place
I never thought I'd be
These tears I'm crying
Are just tears of goodbye
I hope you find someone else
Somewhere in your life

A big blue sky above me
And your two arms around me, baby, every night

Every girl I know likes the way a diamond shines

Same old story at a different time
Lonely is the man low on gin and smokes
Thinking ""Getting what I wanted wasn't worth my soul""
So I'm going back to Houston
In my heart and in my mind
Thinking about what you said when I left it all behind
Losing don't mean nothing when there's nothing to lose
Living isn't living when I'm missing you
Miles from a lover make a heart grow strong
Well, I was weak and the road was long
Took a little time but I'm coming around
And I'm thinking about pointing my headlights south
So I'm going back to Houston
In my heart and in my mind
Thinking about what you said when I left it all behind
Losing don't mean nothing when there's nothing to lose
Living isn't living when I'm missing you
Packing my bag at the old turnpike
Trading this inn for the snow outside
And if these weathered feet never reach their home
Go on, bury me deep where the ground is cold
Bury me in Houston
Where I left my love behind
Thinking 'bout what you said when I crossed that county line
Losing don't mean nothing when there's nothing to lose

as his mother gets the letter saying
""He fought hard""

Spurts the family in the front row

Nicht faehig zu lieben oder liebe ich die Qual
Liebe ich den Schmerz - bin ich nicht normal?

Ich suche nach der, fuer die ich diese Lieder sing'
Nur eine Nacht in meinem Zimmer
Wir wachen auf und leben fuer immer
Ich lass es Traenen regnen

Alles zu setzen Und vielleicht alles verliern.
Doch bist du bereit Und setzt dein Ansehen aufs Spiel,
Wirst du mit Scheiße überhäuft Und kannst nicht davor fliehn.
Chor:Nichts ist so hart wie das Leben,
Wenn man sagt, was man denkt,
muß man mehr als alles geben.
Was hast Du Arschloch schon jemals riskiert?
Ich meine nicht dein Leben.
Nein, was sich lohnt zu verlieren.
Denn wenn du stirbst ist eh alles vorbei.
Der Tod hat keine Konsequenzen,
Macht dir keine Schererein
Gradewegs in'n Himmel.
Und alles ist in Butter.
Vielleicht ein paar Tränen Deiner trauernden Mutter.
Trenne dich von allem.
Es ist gar nicht so schwer.
Von deinen Vorurteilen sowieso,
Sie sind am wenigsten wert.
Denn Courage heißt alles zu riskiern,
alles zu setzen, und vielleicht alles zu verliern."

Ich war Teil der Lösung, und mein größtes Problem
Ich stand vor mir, und konnte mich nicht sehn
Das Gras war grüner. Die Linien schneller.
Der Reiz war größer und die Nächte waren länger
Alles Geschichte, und ich bin froh, daß es so ist.
Oder glaubst Du, es ist schön, wenn man Scheiße frißt
Alles nur Splitter, im Treibsand meiner Seele
Nur wenige Momente, in einem Leben
ich höre himmlisches Gelächter, wenn ich daran denke wie ich war.
An das Rätsel, das ich lebte, und den Gott, den ich nicht sah."

Von Armut und Elend
Von Sehnsucht und Not"

Wie ein Schiff ohne Ruder -
Nichts war klar
Sie nannten mich Idiot
Weil ich die Schule haßte
Sie sperrten mich ein,
Weil ich denen nicht paßte
Ich lebte vom Verbrechen
Von kleinen Hehlereien
Ich hatte ""schlechte"" Gesellschaft
und zu viele Schlägereien
Ich will dich nicht belehren
Du bist selber alt genut
Doch es ist traurig aber wahr
Das Problem bist du
Die Hölle ist in dir
Und kein Ort, an den man geht
unsere Hölle schaffen wir
und nicht der, der vor uns steht
Zu viele Drogen,
Zu viele Schlägereien
Ich war nicht immer Sieger
Aber viel zu oft dabei
Ich weiß wie es sich anfühlt
Wenn Knochen splittern
Ich weiß wie es sich anfühlt
Wenn die Hände zittern
Doch es ist nicht der Schmerz
Der mir Sorgen macht.
Es ist die Hölle
Die du dir schaffst
Denn jeder kann zaubern
Seine Ziele erreichen
Du mußt nur wollen
Du stellst die Weichen"

Mit dieser Band hast du nicht viele Freunde, doch die du hast teilen alles mit dir.
Uns liegt das Herz auf der Zunge, und hier sind die Beweise.
Wir sind duftende Blumen, in Feldern voll Scheiße.
Hier sind Perlen für die Säue, Angst für unsere Feinde,
Tröstende Worte - wenn es sein muß, auch gemeine.

Mach Dich bereit, es kommt die Zeit, in der Du wissen muÃt, wiÃ©s
Weiter geht.
Du hast den Dreck von der Gosse geleckt, du weiÃt, wie

Du hast die StraÃen gesehen, wie Freunde untergehn.
Nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder Letzter sein.
Nie wieder, nie wieder, nie wieder ganz unten sein.

Sollen wir schweigen ? Sollen wir euch ignorieren ?
Doch da wir sowieso dabei sind uns mit allen anzulegen.
Kommt das, was wir von euch hören gerade gelegen.

Und eure Pseudomoral erkannten wir gleich.
Ihr spuckt ganz schön große Töne Könnt ihr euch das Leisten ?
Was wolltet Ihr damit bezwecken ? Was beweisen ?

Ja, ihr habt es geschafft, ich beginne euch zu hassen.
Wenn ich so etwas sage ist es nicht gelogen.
Ihr sollt den Tag nicht vor dem Abend loben.
Ich dachte erst noch: Leckt mich,
doch ihr habt es übertrieben. Ihr habt zuviel geredet
Und beschissenen Lieder geschrieben.
Wer nicht hören will, muß fühlen.
Ihr habt zu lange provoziert.
Zuviel Scheiße erzählt, und nichts kapiert.
Legt euch nicht mit uns an.
Denn wir führen wahren Krieg - Gegen Lügen und Dummheit,
Und das macht uns nicht beliebt.
Doch im Gegensatz zu euch, kann uns nichts passiern
Denn wer keine Sympathie hat, kann sie auch nicht verliern.
Ganz anders als ihr - Sind wir Streß gewohnt,
wir suhlen uns darin, nur so fühln wir uns wohl.

Which hides behind, behind the tears

Known well and favoured
There's no limit to his charm
This illusive adversary, unforeseeable consequences
Absurd behaviour, a macabre like frame of mind
Living for the moment, not a care in the world
Excuses one and more... proclamations he'll make
You must, beware... a hand and arm he'll take
...He'll disregard us all
Though in thee we trust
Lead us not to temptation
Help us one and all
In the company of a force majeure
Lead us, lead us not... beyond the realms of our salvation
No sacrifice is more... than following a force majeure
Each vow is broken, it's a total waste of life
An urge to lead us on, irresistible strange compulsions

So irresponsible, for the fun of it all"

A sacrifice means many things
Determined you won't give in
The answer is loud and clear
Against all the odds you're determined to win
A simple solution exists
Such loyalty and trust you gave
To all your friends
Impossibilities, this task you face

They last forever, an infinity of time
Each day and forever, endlessly the same
Nothing ever happens worth, mentioning again
Significantly quiet as always
It's all we wanna do, we're killing time
Killing time
There's nothing else we'd rather do
Rather do
Than killing time (Just Killing Time)
Late a minute, an hour a perfect time
It doesn't matter now, take a while
Easy does it, don't have a heart attack

Patience is virtue, at least that's what they say
What's the point in hurrying, take it day by day
There's time enough to get things done"

Waiting for someone to come, and crucify me

If humiliation is worse, than all the pain
Sweet revenge is all they seek
Never smile, they never speak
But pretend to be your friend
Then strike you down
Sweet revenge, hatred deep
Say a prayer, then watch you weep
Strong, the mighty, one and all
Each one will fall
Too late, the chase has begun
My every move, they're right behind me
It's never fate, when damage is done
To the bitter sweet end
'Til the battle is won

I'll take 'em all...

358541,the-story,2006,elegy,Metal,"The following tale depicts the life of a vulnerable child born into a
world of poverty and despair. The scene is set in a typical overcroweded
and run down industrial city. A haven for ranks of the unemployed. A young
and naive couple against all odds, ignore the advice of others and
secretly marry. Ignorance playing a major role in their futile lives,
their instincts sadly influenced, she is pregnant with their first
child, while he searches frantically for a means to support them. As time
grows shorter, and his chances slowly diminish, the pressure bears heavily
on his brittle shoulders. Desperately he battles against his own
weaknesses, trying to find strength within. No-longer can he smile, nor
will his conscience give him the freedom to lie or cheat. Exhausted, weak
and weary, he can't bear to face her. Passing a backstreet bar, he's
easily enticed inside, while a stranger sensing his vulnerabilty, helps to
alleviate him from the responsibilty for the couple's last savings. Dumped
in a drunken heap, and the stranger nowhere to be found, the father
struggles to his feet, as the alcohol suppresses his will to fight.
Momentarily he sees a way out. A vantage point high on an empty bridge,
peacefully he falls to his death. Frightened of exposing her identity, she
gives birth in a darkenend backroom. The innocent child free of pride or
prejudice, begins it's long journey discovering life's wonders, and
tragically life's many weaknesses."

as her child demolishes the very fabric she believes in.
Catching an occasional glimpse, she remembers with great pain,
the anguish she felt, as the memories from her past re-appear.
Frustration turns to confused anger.
She still can't come to terms with the fact
that her husband took his own life.
""Why"", she asks herself, ""why didn't he tell me?
Why couldn't anybody lend him a helping hand?""
All the while her son is silently crying out for help.
Intro
Looking back in time,
Without consent.
two lovers ran away
A tragic tale, so often made
So sad and destined to fail
They're in and out of every place
Searchin' hard a sad disgrace
At best a darkened room, without a view
Those memories, still remain
Never once did she complain
Now time repeats itself, all over again
What he did, was insane
Sadly his own life he'd take
And you've been left to face the guilt, alone
Just try to remember
He was a victim of circumstance
Close your eyes, try to recall
The strength you felt
Now, is the time to be stronger
Than you've ever been before
Bury all your anguish and fear, you're not to blame
Don't analyze, come to terms
Face the truth, don't turn away
Where there's a will, there has to be a way
Into the world, your child came
Responsibility or shame
He backed away from you, don't lose him again
You're not alone! you've got to be stronger"

a small town girl who never asked why easy access cum' don't be shy
For no apparent reason when the stakes were so high
she started to play the losers game
Common sense had... no place in their lives we're not so bad is it a crime
cheap solution for the rich to get high no restitution livin' a lie
They should have known better not to turn a blind eye
instead they just left her to die
Fly, children in the sky no escape unless you're willing to die
a price you'll pay, no other way so why do ya wanna play it's losers game
The dealer always wins
Such potential could have gone far her real firends cried

what else could they do once she lost her mind"

My state of mind state of mind
Now the feelings from within tell the tale a life of sin
an' a cold journey through time
I don't recall memories hard to focus hard to please
am I losing my mind
A psychological impulse twisting around inside
My state of mind an out of body experience my state of mind
a separation between the soul and mind to be as one with each other
a state of mind in control of my helpless
The weirdest things always happen could it be my penance
a mnemonic phase that I resist
Now the feelings dark within me my sins will never ever be free
On and on and on we go we live our lives but never show
the knowledge guilt we all possess the strength of mind to now confess"

and turns supreme manipulation into an art form.
On the surface he portrays a person being of caring and consideration,
while his dark side hides calmly, until the moment of truth can appear.
Full of charm, so open minded
Lets you talk 'till you're blue in the face
Compassion sincere
His own portrayal, the proud example to others
When in fact, a covenant he's made
With the dark side of hell
Wait! Don't be fooled by him
Stop! don't go near him
His appearance can change, like the chameleon
We're all his helpless subjects
And like his damaged toys
Once they're of no importance
With savage grace destroys
So supreme, a master to many
An' acts like a friend, offers comfort to all
Patiently, telling wild fabrications
Gaining your trust the thrill, the thrill of it all
Get ready to run!"

Driven by a mother's instinct to protect her child,
her worst nightmares materialise before her very eyes.
A constant fear she has
A mother's instinct to protect
His innocence her child, must not be influenced
Surreal nightmares they appear
Before her very eyes
The walls start closing in, then the madness begins
The consequences of her actions
Into a life of stress he came
Frenzy, frenzy
On the edge of a nervous breakdown
A living hell, going crazy Frenzy, frenzy
The unknown, eats your soul alive
Your heart pounds, your blood is boiling
In her chaotic mind
The darkest secrets she would tell
And smothered them with tales,
Not for others
A psychological affect, she'd created
Caused the child to change, he was never the same
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Telling insane stories over again"

Locked away he hopes to find peace of mind,
but instead he's haunted by the terrifying images in his dreams.
Images of those whose lives he so mercilessly helped to destroy.
All of that money you've made
From all of those souls with their lives they've paid now
Lost your pride, locked inside
Where's the light at the end of the road
Blame and sorrow
No more day, just, tomorrow
Close the door, turn the key
Lock the misery away!
You're living in an ivory tower
All of the guilt you should feel when all of the torment you caused was real
Truth you've found, changed your made
At the end of the road there's a light
So many places, hidden lies, saddened faces
Close the door take the key, try and throw it away far, far away
In a solitary day
There's a solitary point of view
Hide the fear away!
That's the price you have to pay
They're coming to get you, put boards on your windows
It won't take 'em long 'till they find out a way
Don't sleep stay awake now, look over your shoulder
Your enemy's coming to take you away!

Hide your fear away, it strips away the good in you"

cause the child to develop a warped perception of life.
Danger lurks in every place
A mother fights to protect her child
Tradition stipulates its way
It's easy for them to say
Influences all around
Hard to change, creatures of habit
Sacrifices must be made
A few white lies she must tell
The pressure lay on her shoulders
Decisions unfair
Desperately seeking comfort
Searching for strength not there
Have no fear
Unorthodox ways, unorthodox methods
Alone and afraid, different from others
All alone

Hide your tears
Years of hardship and of pain
Corruption lingers in all the dark corners
Her efforts are in vain

Mystified by lies, demoralizing
No second glance, face to face

He'll suck you dry, and leave no trace

Manipulates his way, terrorizing

brought up in a house of strangers
Many years went by so her torment grew a place where children mustn't cry

where reality and thought drift through time
I'm a millionmiles from anywhere a solitary isolation bare

Won't somebody help them anymore like a rock to the ground
they keep falling just when they found a real sense of Direction
We determine our own lives with the power the strength to change them
but when manipulation plays a big part then our future is gone
Suppression won't we bother suppression won't we show a little concern

Hatred, like an infection, spreads from one victim to another.
The resulting factor is a broken spirit; a shadow of his former self.
Suffocating in his own remorse, he fears the unexpected.
His nervousness takes a form of it's own.
It manifests and takes control.
To him it's real.
He's unaware that his mind has shut out his surroundings.
Isolated and alone, he starts to fear, fear itself.
You know what they say, your many victims
What comes around, goes around
Over indulgence, uncivilized
Uncertainty, created your discontentment
His spirit is broken, lives in a world unreal
An infectious hatred

Man's own creation
Manifestation of fear
The mind's exaggeration
First the unexpected, then the unexplained
Being a victim, that makes him so afraid

He battles between right and wrong.
Facing a horrifying decision, which no child should have to make,
his whole life could be turned upside down.
Does he listen to the wishes of his kind, but stressful mother,
to remain living in poverty, and be persecuted by many?
The alternative is to take a road into crime and deception,
with his so called friends.
Either way he'll suffer the consequences.
His mother sad, now she's left alone
No shoulder to cry on, no hand to hold
To stay alive, worked her fingers to the bone
Guilt nor shame, her child must have a home

Not only to repay them in money,
but also to give the reassurance and belief,
that mankind has the ability to change for the good.
Infantile dillusion, played the biggest part
Anger caused confusion
A childhood fear, of fear itself
Mere mortals playing god
It's time to stop, feel the yearning
Mother Nature's calling you, a metamorphosis working
Your body's aching all the time
A shadow lurking
Your saviour's waiting in the wings
Night turns to day, only shame remains real
Take their misery away, redeem
Heal the pain they feel
A chance to turn it all around, a time for sharing
Bury your fears into the ground

Put your hatred aside, hear the calling
Metamorphosis
A transformation of kind forming, a season of good is dawning
Put away those evil thoughts
Open up your heart and breathe

Put your hatred aside, hear the calling

He once so philosophically explained
there's a reason we're brought into this world
I wish he was with us today pray hear me say I understand now
No matter how how hard we try we never listen when destiny's calling
we still keep changing our lives stop, look and listen
it's destiny calling you (when destiny's calling you)
Looking back remissing changes long gone by
opportunities I keep on missing I've stared 'em in the eye
The gravity of all my actions I try hard to disguise
it became crystal clear we change the future affecting all our lives
An old man philosophically explained
there's a reason we're brought into this world
Funny those words that he said will always be true forever and ever
Each promise we break the choice is yours and mine
each wrong move that we make we're missing chances
each step with each day will get harder, harder if we go our own way"

Believing only that people wish him harm,
while all the time there is a sympathetic eye from an admiring lady.
As the years pass, she slowly gains his trust,
but not without incident.
Being of a passive and loving nature,
she helps to transform his anger with regression.
Eventually his fears are changed into a positive belief
in the goodness we all possess.
Ignored by the many, adored by the chosen few
Friends he hasn't any, just his own point of view
There stands a lady inbetween the shadows
Waiting patiently for you
Holding out her hand she whispers
Together we'll pull through
She transforms his anger
Helps him wipe away the tears
I'll be there, standing next to you
I'll be there I will pray, I will pray for you

The audience won't have a choice
But the popstars sing:
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
16 years tomorrow
And I'll never leave you
I'm 17 and tired of life
Under my pillow is a knife
I'm sick and tired of this world
But yet I haven't kissed a girl
I know this world is full of pain
And yeah I haven't cried in vain
'Cause my dog died the other day
And nothing can wash my tears away
But the popstars sing:
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
16 years tomorrow
And I'll never leave you
And I won't sing that I love you
I only sing things that are true
And I won't sing no la la la la la
Because I'm not in love with you
But the popstars sing:
You know that I love you
You know that I need you
16 years tomorrow
And I'll never leave you

When there's a chance to win I lose

I'm invisible to her
And when she walks you think she dancing
And she's got flowers in her hair
She's selling Miller and Bukowski
And all the boys are going ""Ahhh...""

You came to stay but went away
I've lost my love I've been betrayed

And I smile
Cause the tears I cry I cry them inside
I fantasize
But my dreams are crushed when I look in your
In your eyes
Some things remain the same and some things change
A broken heart was all I gained
I turned my head the picture changed
The love I found was killed again

You looked so cool with all the girls and that guy who's gay

I lock my door and stay in bed

I spend an hour a day on the telephone
I only call when I'm sure that you're not at home
But it's so good just to hear your voice on the answering machine
I write 600 letters to you everyday
Then I tear them apart and throw them away
And I'm sure that when I finish this one it will go the same way

And friends with names like Jack and Nash
You book the cheapest trip you can
And then you're off to wonderland
And you get pissed on your way there
And make rude comments to a queer
But Jackie throws him off the boat
A french policeman makes a note
Your friends at work all envy you bacause you've seen the world
You've got some news from Athens and you claim you kissed a french girl
You tell them that you're half a man without all new impressions
You need your kicks like they need air
With pockets full of cash

And Jackie doubts that you're alive

Oh, I thought about you

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you

Obediently I'll bear a name
I'll share it with the wind I tamed

Can you see my heart

Narcissus is back from under water and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back from under water and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back I shouldn't bother I break the mirrors that I meet
Narcissus is back from under water and has his whole lips to drink
The water water is so cold
It poisons anyone who calls
A loving hand and daring kiss
Now watch here's everything you miss
It's getting hard to look away
It's not your real face anyway
This smile's too easy to disperse
Et moi je prie pour une averse
For you to see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you see my heart
Can you
Narcissus is back from under water and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back from under water and kisses his lips again
Narcissus is back I shouldn't bother I break the mirrors that I meet
Narcissus is back from under water and has his whole lips to drink

Where streams gracefully shimmer
And sunbeams dance and glimmer
Grace layer at the river's edge

Dive through beckoning leisure

And left his appetite
Unfed
Alone all his brilliant words
Are dead
Oh flame's still burning

Start to tease her
He turned her world to black
But she's stopped looking back
Tattooed it all in black
Discretion is the key
To his reality
And she feels now she's free
So she chooses then and there
To leave without a care
She goes into the dusk
As easy as a breeze
No longer on her knees
Her soul is now at peace"

I sense a rhythm, that science can't feel
I feel the beat.... of our hearts as one
I hold your color, when my vision is gone
This power is something but the force is blind
Transmitted through a network, of your own kind
As minutes tick away.... and days become years
I know this old feeling, it's a substance in my tears
And the kids on the street
And the kids everywhere
And all I gotta say is the kids don't care
When I hear...
I sense a rhythm...
I feel the beat...
I hold your color..."

If we never meet again I'll sleep till then

I hope I never see this face again

I'll just walk away, walk away, walk away
I'll just walk away, walk away, walk away"

She said she had to squeeze it but she, then she
Oh don't lean on me man, cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man

More and more, now and then
It's more like all the time
It's all the wasted time
Tomorrow's never there
Yesterday has no cares
Lost in memories
Wild, free,
Those days
They're gone
They're gone
Today is everyday
Well that's the way, or so they say
It never seems to pay
It just gets in the way
Some people live in dreams
Living in their TV screen
Someday their time will come
When yesterday is done"
358688,propaganda,2007,blitz,Rock,"Defending this corruption on which you are sat
You tell me what to think, you tell me this and that
`Freedom is O.K. you scum` but make sure it`s never used
In your defence of liberty I always stand accused
And your shadow in the sun always give a shock
While the hate mail rises like some kind of moral rock
Propaganda, you scare me to death
Propaganda, you scare me to death
I know you want to lock me up and see justice done
You say get the army in, you hope that day will come
You will give me something to think about Right between my eyes
Then you`ll see your freedom the day that freedom dies
I can`t see many reds underneath my bed
But the fascists in the letter-box are messing up my head
You tell me I`ve got rights, the same for rich and poor
But you`re behind the police when they`re knocking down my door"

But you gotta think fast before it's too late
Just one cut around your head
Just one minute and you'll call me dead
You better watch out for the razors in the night
You better leave out the razors in the night
Backstreet boys wear boots and braces
Razor blades and angry faces
Too much tension, too much fear
What the hell are we doing here
Murder is the biggest prize in sport
Cause violence is the only game you've been taught
A pool of warm blood is your prize
Or a cold blade across your eyes"
358690,fatigue,2007,blitz,Rock,"Living your life by the minutes on your clock
Forgetting reality by a mental block
You can't stand this and you can't stand that
You also know where it's been but never where it's at
All you factory girls and you factory boys
Whose been winding you up like cheap little toys?
Don't you know you suffer from metal fatigue
Rust never sleeps in the minor league
This is the problem of iron and steel
When you are a cog in a clockwork wheel
You've set your own course down a well trodden path
And made you a cog when you want to laugh
I've got metal fatigue"

Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too
But what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right, believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that
I was so wrong
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from this long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh, so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you
I know you were right, believing for so long
I'm all out of love, what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that
I was so wrong

Dividing every question 'til the questions are complete
Every twisted tongue she studies everyone
She won't leave any stone unturned the night is oh so young
Oh oh she's traveling back in time
Questioning every line that someone said
Oh oh she's trying to understand
Free her mind she's always the analyst
Silent space the culprit the catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life
Digging around in the dirt she's a slave to the work
She's always the analyst
Can you be sure we haven't met see the eyes they don't forget
They wander through the passage-ways that tease a restless mind
Can't afford to slip the picture's gotta fit
Her world's a photograph that gets dissected bit by bit
Oh oh she's traveling back in time
Questioning every line that someone said
Oh oh she's trying to understand
Free her mind she's always the analyst
Silent space the culprit the catalyst
Trying to make sense of her life
Digging around in the dirt she's a slave to the work
She's always the analyst
Re-living the mistake she's made not a moment for the curious girl
Free her mind she's always the analyst
Silent space the culprit the catalyst
Trying to make sense of this life
Digging around breaking it down
Neurotic thoughts
Burning the ground
Every sight every sound
She's always the analyst"

Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind

Seems to have risen just a little soon
But who's calling out my name anyway?
I'm disorientated
I'm trying not to be jaded
When it's all so complicated
Cause I'm a little disorientated
Walking in a different space
Looking back just in case
Out of patience out of balance out of time
Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind
Love is forever
Hate was in the never

Out of breath out of focus these shapes in my mind

I must take hold
I'll keep on spinning until I find myself again
So I woke up and there's the clock
It was ticking backwards had I forgot
But what day is it anyway
I'm disorientated
I'm trying not to be jaded
When it's all so complicated

Needed to feel,

Somewhere to call my sanctuary

To your heart I run
I was deserted like the moon is at the dawn
I never thought I'd ever find a place so beautiful
All my heart was falling like a stone
Deep into an ocean vast and colorful

As an ordinary day I prayed for you a thousand times

I'm gonna love you until the day I die

A picture so it lasts
Let's knock down the walls of immortality
Your fingers on my skin only you can hear my fear
Only you can help me heal

Rewind and erase that shock look on your face 'cause your Mona Lisa is dead

And yesterday's girl is not what you see
It's a terrible case of mistaken identity
The sun likes to rise and the moon likes to fall
And that's kinda like my life
I've played the role of the nice girl next door who gets cut like a knife
Now I'm not looking for apology eyes
And I don't want to spend a night on a bed of beautiful lies
Erase and rewind leave that sick girl behind and fast forward, fast forward

It's the fear of thorns that keeps you out of the garden
Be brave, be the fool, you've never been

Melt me on the path where love could begin
Hearts that don't love can't be broken
A dream stays a dream if not woken

Don't love me with gloves on

Risk a poison kiss just to have my thirst unquenched again
Let love do me in

The need crashes in, I brace for the wave
And pray it will pass, not take me under

My weakened heart that still wants you

Born in the middle, it's hard to be useful,
It's been hell, if I had to be truthful,
Oh! When people grow apart

But it leaves a lotta mess
That someone's gotta clean up
It happened here to the family that I love

They said that like two falling stars we would go down fading fast
But no one could put up the light when we knew it would last
Days go by and you're still by my side
With all we've been through you're the one thing that's true in my life
Days go by, you're sure as the sun will rise
Being together we only get better with time
As days go by
I know that nothing could come between us
When love is real it never goes away
And nobody could shake us or brake us from what we both could see
And now we look back on the past full of beautiful memories
Days go by and you're still by my side
With all we've been through you're the one thing that's true in my life
Days go by, you're sure as the sun will rise
Being together we only get better with time
As days go by
And the world it keeps turning and turning
I'm learning that everything in life must change
But I still feel the same
As days go by
And you're still by my side
Making forever together one day at a time

Making together forever one day at a time

They were the devil's children
Bonnie and Clyde began their evil doing
One lazy afternoon down Savannah way
They robbed a store and
Hightailed outa that town
Got clean away in a stolen car
And waited till the heat died down
Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation
Into the banking business
""Reach for the sky"" sweet-talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag
Now one brave man-he tried to take 'em alone
They left him lying in a pool of blood
And laughed about it all the way home.
Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding
From every American lawman's gun
They used to laugh about dying
But deep inside 'em they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lying
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun
And the morning dew
Acting upon reliable information
A federal deputation laid a deadly ambush
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them
Bonnie and Clyde
They lived a lot together
And finally together,
They died."

Any part of my tomorrow, tomorrow
Cause it's oh, so peaceful here
No one bendin' over my shoulder
Nobody breathing in my ear
Oh, so peaceful here
In the evening shadows are callin' me
And the dew settles in my mind
And I think of friends in the yesterday
When my plans were giggled in rhyme
I had a son while on the run
And his love brought a tear to my eye
And maybe some day he'll up and say
""We had a pretty nice time""
Oh my, oh my

How long has this been going on?
Oh I could feel that I could melt
Into heaven I'm hurled
Oh I know how leif erickson felt
Finding another world
Kiss me once, and then once more
Oh what a dunce I was before
What a break, for heaven's sake

One lazy afternoon down Savannah way,
They robbed a store, and high-tailed outa that town
Got clean away in a stolen car,
And waited till the heat died down,
Bonnie and Clyde advanced their reputation
And made the graduation
Into the banking business.
""Reach for the sky"" sweet-talking Clyde would holler
As Bonnie loaded dollars in the dewlap bag,
Now one brave man-he tried to take 'em alone
They left him Iyin' in a pool of blood,
And laughed about it all the way home.
Bonnie and Clyde got to be public enemy number one
Running and hiding from ev'ry American lawman's gun.
They used to laugh about dyin',
But deep inside 'em they knew
That pretty soon they'd be lyin'
Beneath the ground together
Pushing up daisies to welcome the sun
And the morning dew.
Acting upon reliable information
A fed'ral deputation laid a deadly ambush.
When Bonnie and Clyde came walking in the sunshine
A half a dozen carbines opened up on them.
Bonnie and Clyde, they lived a lot together
And finally together they died,"

I was in the club
Bunch a bad bitchez
Liquor in my system
Equal bad decisions
That is what im known for lemme make it clear
You ain't talkin money i suggest should u dissapear
Ladies and the drinks only reason why im here
If you ain't one of then the exits to the rear
Yea
You hot but yo friend is a beauty
Drop yo snapchat name i know its lookin like movie and im trying to play the co-star
We dont have to go far Im parked out front in case
You ain't bring no car
How long it take you to put on that dress
Im thinkin ten minutes nothin less
I could be wrong
Im just taking a guess
But i respect and recognize you fresh
Its like i
I drift and swerve X16 (hook)
Look at me
Do i seem like im worried
Only thing i press is making money in a hurry
Dippin swervin
Haters what im curving
Scoring when theres pressure steph curry kyrie irving
I guess im like a star
Now that the tables turnin
Feelin like im cube in the 90's higher learning
Feeling like im due all this paper that im earning
The kind that they be claiming but that remains undetermined
Uh
Slow it down
Lean like im in H-town
Its to the point I can't feel my face now
Heat it on hell's kitchen
Or the devils playground
Im in to taking risks I might stay a while
Dont fuck around and get yo pass revoked
Provoking only gets yo ass choked

you push and pull your fate til it's all you can take,
should I just stick around, would it make you happy,
make you happy because
You were always right behind me,
you were always right behind me,
just let go of your your insides, just let go of all of it
This is not the end, because I won't let you go,
you push and pull your fate til it's all you can take,
should I just stick around, would it make you happy,
make you happy because
and if there's more where that came from,
I'd hope to find out someday,
because every breath that I take feels like I'm breathing for two,
I only feel for you"

stop to think about my actions, why I cant control them
I know that, this could be, the last good think that Ill see
so why should I, even try, to prove what I cant deny
You waited, for this, to say
Just give me one last day, I know you care about me
you think about me, just one last day, I know its not that easy to say you
need me
Time is wasted by the hour and I forget how we got sour
waiting in my patient bed for something that may never come
I know that, this could be, the last good thing that Ill see
so why should I, even try, to prove what I cant deny
How many things could change, when you cant recognize your own face and all
these words I say, could they mean a thing
one last day, I know you care about me, you think about me, just one last
day, I know its not that easy to say you need me
just one last day, this whole world is changing but were not fading just
one last day, I know its not that easy, to say you need me"

wide awake and I can't feel it
Of all these things I should have said but never got to,
I would have never led you on because that's the difference
and take back your knife caught in my back,
don't worry I'll be fine,
just like old friends like ones we hate,
for everything you've done to me, am i still breathing,

you can try and try, try to get the best of me,

Pull these bedsheets over me and let me be
With broken hearts and black and blues
I' m shivering because I wondered what you'd think
If I didn't break and made a change for you
It feels like
The first time
That I am standing on my own,
And I'm not wasted tonight, not wasted tonight
It takes a part of me, can't you see?
I'm pushing through your tidal waves, so I can breathe
With no regrets, so bittersweet
I'm holding on because I waited for your call
If you care at all, I will wait for you
Tonight I throw myself into, this blanket of relief
Where I can get release, but you can't understand

Sing anthems out to you"

But it's not like friends just come and go, do you understand
These situations make me, find accusations easy
It's safe enough to say you don't need me
I'm sorry, I can't help, you've got to pick yourself up
And I promise, I will stay, you've got to pick yourself up, hey
And I know that everyday you wake up feeling less than worthless
But it's not like you ever let it show, do you understand

It's safe enough to say you don't need me
I'm sorry, I can't help, you've got to pick yourself up
And I promise, I will stay, you've got to pick yourself up, hey
Because every single word that leaves you
Falls onto the floor beneath you
You're killing me, you're killing me
It's not the way it's supposed to be

you could waste your whole life
you'll never get the best of mine

Why every other words a hypocrisy
Figure this one out it'll all make sense cause I
was left in July
There it goes, my innocence to whoever will rise above the rest
There it goes, my innocence to whoever will rise above you
Don't tell me - everything you want is so far away
With everything you have is so tucked away
Pieces of my life are lost and gone again
Stupid little notes and three page rhymes

the summer comes to a close,
and no one knows what we know,
no one knows
I can't explain, what made me stay,
I fall into the same mistakes,
like all good things, they never last, the past is past
I'd rather be drowning, than swimming away,
that's something that will never change,
I swallow regret, and I hope for the best,

this is why I never try
I never try
This air is contagious, no one can save us, but I wait
I must confess, I'm not impressed,
there's nothing worse than losing you,
I must confess, I'm not the same like all good things

Baby slash my throat but don't drive me home

Just like I love to hate and break you
And now I fall in kind of deeper
Because now we're closer
And I've never felt so hardcore
Just like the time we laid in bed all day
And watched the whole fucking world just fade away
Fight the fade with you, and never fall
because i fight the fade with you
Like a bullet to my gut when you touch my skin
Now lay your head back
And tell me all your tears goodnight
Now we say goodnight"

because there's no way I will change
on the way home, my good intentions arrive,
a little late though, not too late to try,
ashes to ashes, could we get past this,
because there's no way I will change
This is the part where I give in,
because I don't want to miss a thing,
the weight of the world holds me down once again,
but it's fine because it's all I've ever known in this life
on the way home, we threw our patience aside,
these broken arrows, you know they sting everytime,
take your position baby, the opposition of me,
because theres no way I will change
it's all in our minds, we're losing the time,
we'll never get back, swallow that pride,

The books that I read, the things that I watch
And it's not too unusual to ask my age
Or what's my favorite drink
And then the midnight shift arrives
Backing up the stars that cry your name
And you always say something gets in the way
That tears you inside
If I fall today, If I fall to break, Hold me up
I'm holding on just to feel dark shade
Then moving on to the next of the days
Now don't you feel like you've been here before
Or do you feel like you want it more
There's days like this when I need you now
To hold me up, to let me down
Because letting go is the easiest thing
When letting go is the only way
If I fall today
If I fall to break
Hold me up
If I fall today
To break"

if hesitation is what kills, now you've lost everything
You're way too late, because I'm already gone,
for now im out, I guess im saving myself
The closer that we get, the more that I regret,
for losing out on all, that never let me fall,
and now I face it all again until I can't pretend,

I found my place, im just a waste of life

I feel I'm very into you, yes we're far
Face up, today I'm gonna find that I'm just like you
Face up, today I'm gonna find that I'm just like you
Just because your coming out
Don't look away to pass the doubt on you

You could be something sweet, or pure, or senseless
You're always defenseless, but now your shaking

When everything is crashing down on me
When all you want to do is sit tight
It's what I'm looking for in life
And if we all just wait a while
We'll get let down so easy now

Why can't I just own up
To all my faults and lack of luck

These are my faults"

Say goodbye to me,

If this wasn't your plan, what was it then,
to leave me like this, I can't understand
the point of all that you've done with your time,
in pictures your mine
lift your head, out of bed and realize,
that everything else is a lie,

And I love to see her light
Her eyes light up like fireflies
And I can't wait to see her
So catch me on a good day
Because I might just find a better place to play
Just to bring you back
It's not that I don't care at all
It's just that I can't watch you burn

Was everything always my fault
No I'll never be, No I'll never see
No I'll never be the thing you need
Though through all of this I swear
That I'll pretend to understand
Fate was not a question less than answers leading as she came around
I kind to feel like I'm losing you and losing time, and losing all that's true
Well someday I'll notice you in photographs in ashes of the past

Just say anything, I'll believe you
Just say anything, I'll believe

Waiting for the shit to hit the fan

To look above, and taste the sky
Bittersweet kiss with her lips so dry
And there were always things that we kept inside

And there were always things that I can't let go
Everything I can't breakthrough to now
I'll never walk away from once again
Letting go of all the words I haven't said
And breaking through to let go
Face down, I face the ground
Saturday hits and now were up in arms
So tell me this, and tell me that
Your days of alcohol are going to come right back
And there are always things that we kept inside
And we don't know why

You took it all away, all of the better ways

I can't take the fights
I'm bleeding tonight
Well are we down again
We're more than friends
Taking me all the way
I'm waiting I'm saving all the words to say, to someone like you
You always knew me well, when no one knew me quite as well
And figure things out nicely like you do
When you were really young and careless as they seem
It seems you never knew the real me basically

Humanap ka ng pangit at ibigin mong tunay, kung yan ang dapat mong ginawa, kaya makinig ka sakin and it goes something like this
[VERSE 1]
Desi sais na taon oh kaibilis iha nong una mong marinig ang aking kanta
Kay sarap balikan ginintuang nakaraan
Sa humanap ka ng pangit ay nag kantahan
Minimurize sinaulo ng milyong milyong katao
na ang importante sa lahat ay pagkatao at hindi ang itsura na nakakalinlang manloloko mandaraya kaya wag narin lang
Binuwag ko ng pagitan ng maganda at pangit na mula noon nililibak at nilalait, kinukutya inaapi nilalayuan minamaliit tinatawanan at tinatapak tapakan
Pero not anymore hindi mo na mararanasan ang pagdirian ka na para bang isang basahan dahil tao ka na may dangal at kagandahan, gandahan ng ugali na di makita sa iba
[CHORUS]
Ikaw ang pinakamaganda
Babae sa balat ng lupa
Ikaw ang pinakamaganda
Babae sa buhay ko
[VERSE 2]
Kaya dahil sa humanap ka ng pangit natupad
Pamilyang pinapangarap at hinahangad
Kuntento sa asawa ngayon ay masaya
Kahit di sila mayaman buhay ay maganda
Guess what labing labing gabi at araw
Maligayang samahan ay talaga abot tanaw
Hindi panandalian bagkus magtatagal humble may puso nakinig sa aking pangaral
At dahil sa kanyang pamilya ang buhay ay masarap
Kuntento sya sa partner at hindi nag hahanap ng iba you know why? kasi walang kwenta what for para saan pa ehh okey na
Mapagmahal sa pamilya (kami ay mabait) kuntento sa asawa (at wala kaming kabet)
Diba pinapangarap nyo yun ang mag sama ang pamilya ng mahabang panahon
REPEAT CHORUS
Pero sa mga lalake at babae na hindi sa kin sumunod Imbes na nagrerelax ngayon sila'y nakaluhod.Mga lalake at babae na pinagtawanan ako.At niloko loko nila ang awitin kong ito.Sila ngayon ang gabi gabing binabangungot na sa asawa nila ay may umaasungot.Na ang lalake may ginagawang hiawag sa dilim at sa asawang babae may ibang tumitikim.Hindi sila naniwala sa kanta ni andrew e kaya ngayon broken hearted at broken family.Bugbugan sakitan tapos nun hiwalay depressed lahat at gusto na nilang pakamatay	Kaya para lumigaya ang inyong buhay humanap ka ng panget at ibigin mong tunay.At kung hindi sige ka puso mo'y mabibiyak.At ang di sumunod noon ngayon umiiyak....

Nag-me-meneshatoua daw siya sa Alabang
Ako ay umakbay, mahigpit na mahigpit
Naglalaway sa palda niyang hapit na hapit
Nang ako'y makalinga di ko siya matagpuan
Ubos ang aking money, di ko pa nahalikan
CHORUS:
When the night has come
At pinatay ang ilaw
Oh, madalas, lumalabas
Banyo queen
Oh darling, darling, stand by me
Oh - oh stand by me
Oh madalas, lumalabas
Banyo queen
Kaya doon sa bar ako'y kanyang inaya
Inom daw kami at siya ang taya
Kaya't kaming dalawa uminom ng beer
Inangat ko ang mug at ang sabi niya sa 'kon ""Cheers""
Ang 'di ko alam ay maroon s'yang inilagay
Ako'y biglang nahilo, nawalan ng malay
Nang ako'y magising, aking napansin
Pangalan ng motel ""Anito Inn""
Kaya't ang sabi ko: Naku! i-isplit na ako!
'Pag nabuko ang girlfriend ko, mahirap 'to
Nawala sa isip ko ang kanyang baywang
Nang nakita ko siya naka-twalya lang
CHORUS:

Es mi alma que quiere
Volver a verte
Volver a verte
Si un dÃ­a en la lluvia
Acaricia tu cuerpo
No es agua mi amor
Son tan solo mis besos
Si el sol en la calle
Calienta tu cara
Son rayos de amor
Que me salen del alma
Si el aire una tarde
Alborota tu pelo
No es el viento, soy yo
Que quisiera vivir
En tu pensamiento
Esa triste guitarra

Con el tumbao' que tienen los guapos al caminar
Las manos siempre en los bolsillos de su gabÃ¡n

Usa un sombrero de ala ancha de medio lao
Y zapatillas por si hay problemas salir volao'
Lentes oscuros pa' que no sepan quÃ© estÃ¡ mirando
Y un diente de oro que cuando rie se ve brillando
Como a tres cuadras de aquella esquina una mujer
Va recorriendo la acera entera por quinta vez
Y en un zaguÃ¡n entra y se da un trago para olvidar
Que el dÃ­a estÃ¡ flojo y no hay clientes pa' trabajar
Un carro pasa muy despacito por la avenida
No tiene marcas pero toos' saben ques' policia uhm

Mientras camina pasa la vista de esquina a esquina
No se ve un alma estÃ¡ desierta toa' la avenida
Cuando de pronto esa mujer sale del zaguÃ¡n
Y Pedro Navaja apreta un puÃ±o dentro 'el gabÃ¡n
Mira pa' un lado mira pal' otro y no ve a nadie
Y a la carrera pero sin ruido cruza la calle
Y mientras tanto en la otra acera va esa mujer
RefunfuÃ±ando pues no hizo pesos con quÃ© comer
Mientras camina del viejo abrigo saca un revolver, esa mujer
Iba a guardarlo en su cartera pa' que no estorbe
Un trenta y ocho esmithanhueson del especial
Que carga encima pa' que la libre de todo mal
Y Pedro Navaja puÃ±al en mano le fue pa' encima
El diente de oro iba alumbrando
Toa' la avenida, se le hizo facil
Mientras reia el puÃ±al le hundÃ­a sin compasiÃ³n
Cuando de pronto sonÃ³ un disparo como un canon
Y Pedro Navaja cayÃ³ en la acera mientras veÃ­a, a esa mujer
Que revolver en mano y de muerte herida ahÃ­ le decÃ­a
Yo que pensaba 'hoy no es mi dÃ­a estoy salÃ¡'
Pero Pedro Navaja tu estas peor, no estas en na
Y creanme gente que aunque hubo ruido nadien saliÃ³
No hubo curiosos, no hubo preguntas nadie llorÃ³
SÃ³lo un borracho con los dos cuerpos se tropezo
Cojio el revolver, el puÃ±al, los pesos y se marchÃ³
Y tropezando se fue cantando desafinao'
El coro que aqui les traje y da el mensaje de mi cancion
La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios

Quien a hierro mata, a hierro termina
La vida te da sorpresas
Sorpresas te da la vida ay dios
Valiente pescador, al anzuelo que tiraste
En vez de una sardina, un tiburÃ³n enganchaste

Always heard as gram my tripping while we're playing 21

Throwin money and on every game we're playing in
505 people from the... , you better win
Put the reminestry, eye-eye, let's play the ten to that... knock on the door
We hear it from his mom, saying mentions got all
We don't know if we gonna survive,
And the same couldn't stop the bleeding from his brain
He's gone tears share, the block was never the same.
It's time passes.
Yeah, puritan ave, looking over your shoulder
You don't realize you from the ghetto till you get a little older
On summer time, high be, summer time spitely
Somehow I had the white ring, rover put nightly
My nigga dray up, like yo I got this whipsless chick
You wanna lay up when you see that creep in
Great goose, hoped in, rooms like every weekend,
... just wanna blaze up,
Blowin' money at the young age, to expect from some young players

Ayo, this is how we chill from 2010
Shoutout to my niggas in Hiero
I go, I know my flow, is still kinda psycho, sideshow
Yo but it's alright though
They watch me ignite those mics like
I be spittin' pyro like those likewise
Light chicks with the light brown like eyes
Dark skin, nice thighs, right,
And nice, when my sight seen her from behind
But, this is how it feels when you stackin' a mil
Why hate, I just let the haters debate
About how he's great,
And how he ain't, and how he can't spit
And how he ain't that and ain't this
While saying, I wish my shit banged like this
Yeah, when i create somethin' like this
Then my mind's great
High, in my Jimi Hendrix mindstate
But here comes the great showman
I show you somethin' great as Beethoven
Playin' deaf with his earlobes closed
And ya'll niggas ain't focused
Like a camera lens that ain't showin' the pic
As clear as clean water flowin'
(Chorus)
Yeah, from the bottom of the totem pole,
To the top like an overflow,
I give ya'll the overdose, overdose

huh, huh, i'm a... that's the truth, huh, i'm a... that's the truth, huh... i'm the truth, salute.)

Yeah,
Ayo, who's the best
Heavy like dumbbells on your arms
I bury you broads
While spittin' barbarian bars
Yo, I play my cards right but he don't play
Movie script, gang shit, Carlito's way
Push cars, broads, see those papes
My hoods like the Detroit zoo,
And nigga, ya'll see those apes
Spit raps that's phenom great
I'm like Star Trek, spit a verse,
Niggas get the Cleon face
I'm beyond great
Just put a beat on or
Gimme the MP, I beat all breaks
Don't like me so what
I feed off hate
But most likely
You starvin', I eat all day
Plus, bad broads like Beyonce
I skeet on face
While ya'll beat off to skeet tapes
It don't matter still makin' a killin'
Crush the game like King Kong feet on a building

Had a cousin made me lookout to make sure no one was looking
Put the stash in the bag, stash the bag in the bushes
Didn't want me there no either
Fuck rules, took jewels, ran by hood procedures so spring
He flagging at his granny house just to stay fresh, didn't want that, no hand-me-downs
The cost of that drama, so money flow, lil' gold plus a couple baby mommas
Yeah, go there like snow there
Brand new whips and robbing slowly
Pour them boys in the neighborhood they know me
Whips too nice, they might be stolen
He gotta be rolling, you gotta be kidding
On a social ride, nigga, you gotta be sniffing
Only thing inside was a CD with the name on it
Let it slide but the next guy might just put the blame on him
Nothing changed on that block we used to run one up
Some heads left and a few more houses boarded up
They needed more than luck but they seem to crack a summertime smile
And this city more than rough

What it's, what it's worth
Honestly, gotta ask myself
Time and time what I'm working for
Is it worth it, though?
Look, fans ain't realizing when I'm working, though
Keep they pockets filled with stacks
Gotta keep food up in they fridge
Keep my moms out of that trap
Keep my bro up out of that pen
Never had a land in hand, always had to play my part
Play it smart
All that's about is craft
But sometimes survival is getting hard
Yo, this life is bigger than me, feel weighed down by a hundred problems
Got a family on my hands, crown on my head, city on top of my shoulders
Fuck what these niggers say, fuck what these niggers think
It ain't worth the time
You got fans with they hands in the air
Making sure you're not working a regular job on a regular
You got niggers tryina live they dream
But you got niggers that live the reality, not tryina live above they make
This what, this kinda life I dream
Two shots to the head, two shots till we dead
Just what this kind of life might bring
That's what this kinda night might mean
You clock in or be clocked in, OGs here, no stopping
As long as breath's in my lungs waving white flags ain't never the option
What it's worth
What it's, what it's worth
I see I'm talking and debating about my rating
If I only had one fan ring behind I could never feel underrated
So I hear too many questions about
Why you not working, when the latest out
Never was one, go to another one just to feel validated 'bout
Shit, I'm doing all amount of work
Tryina give 'em what they asking for
Yeah, I'm built from the borough but I'm not a hero
Hood past with a past pro, hit a toenail, go back to the mold
But it sound like we're raised around criminals just to hear shots outside of the door
Give a fuck less about shots and subliminals
Let it breathe, let it doze, me and my niggers had dreams
Cashing checks with seven Os
PA, Westside, hop in the truck like let's ride
Mom's looking at the time, hoping that I owe this song, make it back inside
And I did that, live by a code, live for tomorrow
Walk down streets where empty hollows stray 'round broken bottles
I did that, went from one bath and a deck, go wrap on the neck
Double track and the deck, lay it back on cassette
Yeah, yeah, they lived that
What it's worth
What it's, what it's worth

Give you two last names?
Did she have expectations for you?
Did you let her down like we knew you would do?
Gordon James, I know we're all subject to change
But you were way too young to lose your soul
They say you traded it away
Did you think you could just buy it back someday
Gordon James, were you too busy
Ducking the blame
To realize that it's you we now fear?
Maybe someday soon, it will all be so clear
Were you lonely?
Yeah, we were all lonely
Were you scared?
Yeah, well I'm scared too
Did your dreams turn black
Or did you sleep like a child?
Did your heroes die off
Leave you alone in the wild?
Or is this just the path that you choose?
Were you blinded?
Yeah, we were all blinded
The trick is, they say to heal yourself
Did you just let go of the reigns one day?
Let the ocean's current wash you away
Were you all alone when you fell
Gordon James, did your momma die
From the shame?
Was she trying to pull you back into the light?
But you were way too far gone to save
Do you even visit her grave
Gordon James, do you think it's too late to change
To make up for the lives that you bought and sold
And the war machines that you traded for gold
Could this be the day that you pray
Do you think it really matters anyway"

And as our time draws nearer
I wonder just when we stopped being young
And I know my greatest deeds will go unnoticed
And our treasures were here all along
Child of the earth hear my confession
Please don't tell me that it's overdue
And from the four corners of the universe
I will make my way to you

And a breath that comforts like the rain
And a taste no other shall ever know
That upon my tongue shall remain

Hold me close to your breast
Dress my wounds with your innocence
I am weary let me rest
Let your rain wash over me
You know all I ever hoped to be
Is half of what you are to me
So take me from this island
Lead me to the mountains of the moon
As long as you lead I will follow
And the end of time will be too soon

Please don't tell me that it's overdue

But a whisper cannot be ignored

When desperation's all you can afford
Knowing all along
The truth will overcome

Anger and tears
Will wash away our fears

Revisions are not always wrong

Dangerously twisted

It's like drowning in moonlight
Discards them when she's done
They're lost in her twilight
I watch her move from star to star and I wonder why
Why it feels so right
She's so beautifully broken
You can barely see the flaw
Especially from a distance
Which is always how I fall
Why do I fall for the dangerous ones
The ones that never learned to let go
And why do I lie to myself and pretend that I can break her

To go astray

Silver clouds turn to golden stairs
And everything that you used to know
Is slipping away
Here I've got my puzzle-piece
Only got it for a short term lease
No time for asking
No going back to get hurt
I take a little from the mixture
Try to fit it into the picture
Got a place where you're standing
Dig your shoes into the dirt
Trying hard to get back
Runnin' on the stones
Put you on my shoulders

There's a reason to be home
There's a feeling when you smile
But it feels like it might take over
This feeling deep inside
And there's a distance down the line
Far away from the station
We can leave it all behind
On a rolling creation
Sit away from the window
And lock the door
Can't you learn from the last time
And the time before
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look
Got to leave town
To see the yellow flowers bloom
Sun going down
It's gonna be rising soon
On the banks of the deep end
Twisted as a river bend
Searching for a reason to go astray
You couldn't hire twenty-five men
To do what the man could do
Just the sound of his walking
Could split the whole damn town in two
Into the night full of shadows
He still walks when the thunder rolls
This river ain't shallow
Reminds us that the bell still tolls
Bears in the kitchen
Tigers on TV
The singer's pretending
That this song's for me
See the world's still spinning 'round
Gettin' dizzy when we look
You took a wrong turn
Down by the waterline
I heard they had to drag you off the sand
Find a dune and the wind will miss you
Hold on to a piece of dry land
Got to hold on to a piece of dry land
Got to hold on to a piece of dry land

d'ora in poi i legami
un minuto di raccoglimento
oggi si spento un sogno
conti fino a cento e torni a vivere
perch hai bisogno e se andrai lontano
f che non sia troppo fuori mano
o trova un posto irraggiungibile
e caler la fine in questo cine
senza schermo io e te
come in un fermo immagine
attori e spettatori, chiama la polizia
che ho appena fatto fuori
la tua bella allegria
per risparmiarle ancora dei dolori
non la potevo pi soffrire
e non dovr soffrire pi
Ci amammo alla follia
poi siamo rinsaviti
per quella malattia di noi guariti
da quel fottuto medico del tempo
al crocevia di una via crucis
via la croce e cos sia
fammi andar via
aiutami
in questa eutanasia
non ci ameremo pi qui ma attraverso
ci che in altri giorni avremo perso
e nei ritorni della gelosia
ce lo divideremo
quel che pagheremo al boia
per crepare poi di noia
ma che sia morte e mai ferita
quando tu chiederai
i baci e un'altra vita
agli uomini usurai
diglielo che tra noi non finita
che ti ho fregato tutto che sei in lutto
che sei roba mia
l'avrebbero chiamato poi
il nostro numeretto e tocca pure a noi
noi dentro il sacchetto
di questa sporca tombola del mondo
che vuoi che sia sia che sia s
sia che sia no lascia che sia cos
poi sia poesia
fammi andar via
perdonati
questa vigliaccheria
fammi andar via via
fallo per me
fammi andar via da te"

Break loose
Tight grip
Knocking me unconscious when she bit her bottom lip

359415,new-eyes,2014,clean-bandit,Electronic,"In the quiet of my room
I gather up my thoughts and questions
Could I ever be like you?
Could I ever be a person, so real and so true?
It seems implausible
I look at my reflection
If only I could say
The things I never mention
The things you never knew
And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes
Once upon a time there was a girl who so much loved the world
She gave her only begotten sunshine
And dried her stained eyes on a neck tie
Took the best lies made 'em truths
And spit sad soliloquies in the booth
'Cause people think they know but they barely knew
The reality of what the other-siders do
But I've been there, I've learned that
Seen a whole bunch of world and done came back
Got a reckoning for wrecking in my knapsack
'Bout to journey on foot through the outback
GRRRL PRTY is the label on my snapback
Doin' worldwide shows in a black hat
'Bout to tell your ass a story so take that
Free prophecies from a black cat
Seen his demise with a pair of brand new eyes
It was sickening, guy
Never wanted to be stickin' it to thickening thighs
But now he deeper than the secrets that he keep with a lie
""Mm, tastes good!"" baby say with a cry
Now wait
Thinkin' about it too much, too much
Deepen the profit sooner, sooner
He never wanted to be a loser
But the bruises of losing is oozing through his fingers
The tips that like to brush at my hips
Is now at the hilt of a sword, Lord
On the battlefield, torn, sworn
To never think about another lover
Hopin' he had time to recover but nothing's ever easy
Beware the sting of queen bee (Grr!)
And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down
I'm trying, I'm learning as I stumble along
To see this new world without your eyes
So many things in he I would like to be
Wiser, more light on my feet
I could look up in the mirror and change me
Or right over my shoulder and save me
Thinkin' about back, back when, when I ain't have nothing
Not a thing or a ring to my name
Now my feet in the game, knee deep, don't speak
Feelin' like Gwen Stefani in this thing
But I can't complain 'cause we asked for this
Feelin' like a workaholic or a masochist
Don't call like I should like it's sacrilege
To make a dollar in a dream into packed venues
Take a second, put your shield down
Laying down my sword, getting off the battlefield now
Makin' bigger moves, bigger pictures in my view now
Get up out of my way I've got ammo for days, pow!
I can feel the weight of wars you've lost
They're victories in my eyes
Every swing you take brings me closer and closer
Open the gates and I'm poised to charge
You told me we'd never get this far
Now we at the final round
There's no way we'll escape battle scars
Battle scars
And I'd like to thank you for the human I've become
I'm sorry if I've let you down

You better get real, real, real and
Realize that the situation's going nowhere
Because you act so tough I've totally lost control
So please try to understand that if I could
I'd call and I would be there
And if it didn't hurt so much you know I'd give you it all
Imagine if the hope that you thought you knew
Wasn't really true!
It just existed in your head
The reflection used wasn't you,
Completely unaware could be anywhere, any time,
'Cause there was shift in the paradigm
As the dust clears and it all starts to disappear,
It may get harder 'cause you just restarted
And wherever you are, land on another star!
It may get harder 'cause you just restarted
You better get real, real, real and

Twinkle in the shadows

An echo in the wind
Across the summer lake

Every hour that passes is one that I've lost
To figure it out, I'm counting the cost
Gratification that has no delay
Its gone in an instant, do you think its okay?
And all of your enemies are closing in tight
You're down to the left, and they're up to the right.

Like a beautiful ??? with a worn out welcome
You know that I'd love to sit and stare ???

I am ready anaesthetize
You can remove the fear that's here inside my eyes

Keeping those four feet off the floor

Of wanting and wishing you're here
So are you somebody who I'd pick up for?
Somebody new or a drug
That's going straight to my veins
Or into my heart
Or is it all in my head?
I'm just spinning in you
Tired of throwing these thoughts at the wall
Seeing you there, going nowhere
You remind me how everything will turn out in time
To picture the shape of your life
So are you somebody who I'd pick up for?
Somebody new or a drug
To go straight to my veins
Or into my heart
Or is it all in my head?
I'm just spinning in you
It makes me feel better to know that you know what I mean
Cause I've always got something to say
Cause the sooner we wait for our story book scene
To find us and take us away
Won't you take me away?
So are you somebody who I'd pick up for?
Somebody new or a drug to go straight to my veins
Or into my heart? Or is it all in my head?

I'm just spinning around in you.

You never know, so don't you miss the chance to tell somebody so
I love you always, I should've looked you in the eye, should've told you long ago
I love you always, I know it takes you by surprise, but I've gotta let you know.
I'll always be you're one and only son
And I'm so glad to be alive

You're my dad

If you go away, to find yourself a better day
I know its hard to say goodbye, its not the way we planned.
And if you leave, my heart is in your hands.
Looking back on yesterday, I swear it was a dream
There was nothing that could come between us, so it seemed.
But you can go no further now, you're up against the wall.
See, the hole we're standing in started off so small.
If you leave, can you leave it in my hands?
If you go away, to find yourself a better day
I know its hard to say goodbye, its not the way we planned.
And if you leave, my heart is in your hands.
One of these days I'll wake up to the sounds of a parade
And there'll be joy and laughter every day.
But how am I supposed to take up all the years that must go on?
And how can I be happy with the rest of my life if the rest of my life is gone?
If you leave, can you leave it in my hands?

I'm fading but I'm never going down without a fight
So I'm waiting for your something supernatural tonight.
Knocking on your door
You open up then let me in
I've heard it all before
But I'm falling short again
Nothing on my arm
But a body ...
You stay here in control
You say I'm never gonna win another day
No not today
So I'm fading but I'm never going down without a fight
I'm waiting for your something supernatural tonight.
I'm fading like a fireball that burned out way too bright
I'm waiting for your something supernatural tonight.
Do you really think its necessary, all this in between?
Do you really know that this is where I find out what it means
To be all you ever wanted me to be?
To see all you ever wanted me to see?
I see two stars collide
And it makes me starry eyed
It truly disappears
For a hundred thousand years
I should get out of this car
Go chase that shooting star

Too much longer than I'll never walk away

To put this drop on a shelf

Laid
Out
on my bed
Paralyzed dreaming of death
Oh the summer how we cantered proud
of each other, proud of the summer
Hair
Drape down like capes
Tangled in
knots, covered in sand
Ohhh tangled we get, through tangents of
death
Spiraling colours through black holes of culture
I wait...
For ribs
to part, reach in and pull out beating organs
And throw the mess to the
curious blank of the
Two of us whom started, til two of us got square
We sat
and shook like homeless
And reluctantly dissolved
Into the social vacuum
lesser when we left deprived
And lay vacantly
The two of us got started,
then the two of us got square
and rid the woe between us
by fucking hard and
drinking equally
For ribs to part, reach in and pull out beating organs
And
throw the mess to the curious blank of the
Two of us whom started, til two of
us got square
We sat and shook like homeless
Then Stood and reluctantly
dissolved
To the vestige of our state
That observes like flightless
owls
While the men drink and note their words to Commonwealth and the
Queen
We rely in our mother and our sister that are there to keep our
heads
While the men fight like lions, for the Commonwealth and the Queen
I
know no men who are lions
Boasting or showing symptoms of life
Live for
themselves but not die for the Queen
Men are not lions
Blessed nor
confident and living for blood
Proud of the summer and kissed by the
sword
That killed off our common sense
The owls and lions are proof
And
how I drank, vomited common sense
Oh destoroyer, I've grown up too
fast
And how I hung breaking my vertebrae
Held in my fists were the letter
to owls
In Soho, In Soho, In Soho
see how I hung?
I drank myself to
choice
For the Commonwealth and the Queen
In Soho, In Soho, In Soho
see
how I hung
I gave up on love
For the Commonwealth and the Queen

see how I hung?
I drank myself to choice
For the
Commonwealth and the Queen
In Soho, In Soho, In Soho
see how I hung?
I'd
light up on stage
For the Commonwealth and the Queen

way
And my sister turned away
The system got the best of us

Our love will never end
You shield me from danger, you're my shelter
You are my hiding place

Making sure that I'm alright
When I'm falling fast, you rescue me, you love unconditionally
And when I'm clod and so alone
Back in your arms I feel at home
I pray that you will always be, a guardian Angel

I make mistakes, get in trouble, time and again
I ain't proud of who I am
When I'm down you understand
Blinded you can always seem to show the way
You're the light You're the reason I'm here today

Standing here in front of you this perfect day
It's hard to imagine where tomorrow will lead

The will to follow through
And I never lost the strength within
And it's all because of you
I'm flying high like the wind
Reaching the impossible, I'll never doubt again
I'm flying high 'cause your love's made me see
That anything is possible
Possible 'cause you believe in me
In a world full of strangers, you were my saving grace
You told me I was not alone
Alone in this place, no
I never believed it that a dream can come true but
If anyone has changed my mind then baby it's you
Even through the rain I kept my faith
The will to follow through
And I'll never lose my way again
And it's all because of you
I'm flying high like the wind, reaching the impossible
I'll never doubt again, I'm flying high
'Cause your love's made me see
That anything is possible
Possible 'cause you believe in me
It's possible to spread my wings
And reach into the sky
Believe that I can fly away
When you're by my side
I'm flying high ohhh

They mean everything to me

I love them forever
And a day......
Without them I'd die of sadness
One day of loneliness would kill me
Singleness is an impossible consequence
So I'll be with them forever.....

If they died suddenly
In a car crash
If they fell off a cliff
I'd jump after them

Did you ever hear the cry?
Did you ever see the colours fade away?

I'm never gonna love again, the way that i loved you
I'm never gonna smile again
I will be forever...

Blue like the ocean
Silent, waiting
Blue like the the river floating by
I will tell you you'll find but,
it won't be true,
If i can't have your love (If i can't have your love)
If i can't be with you ill be forever blue
Did you ever see the sunrise?
Did you ever feel my pain?
Did you ever see the sun go down?
When you, when you left me in the rain?
I'm never gonna love again
So say it isn't for
I really want to smile again
Don't want to be forever...

Where do you come when the winds go rollling in?
How do you cope when the hearts got a mind of its own?

And there's nothing that you can rise above
That's when you know that you're in love

When you see your soul reflected in their face

And it'll hit you just like thunder

When you feel you're alive for the very first time
And when you hold them in your arms and can't let go

For all of my life I have been searching
For something I couldn't find
But now that I know that you are the one
I understand, I read the signs

I'm every breath

I've known you forever
I've followed you everywhere
I'm every scar
I'm who you are
When you think you're alone
When you cry cause the world's unfair
You can rest assured
I'm always there
Even when you feel like you don't belong
Even when you fall and it all goes wrong
Know that I'm with you, with you all the time
Say a little prayer for the restless heart
We shall never, ever drift apart
Know that I'm with you, know that I'm with you
With you all the time
I walk your every road
I'm laughing when you smile
And when you cry
I cry too
I made you a promise
That I shall forever keep
You're on your own
But not alone
When you're down, when you're out
When the world tells you no-one cares
You can rest assured
I'm always there
Even when you feel like you don't belong
Even when you fall and it all goes wrong
Know that I'm with you, with you all the time

Why I'm not longer missing your kiss

We're still alive but hope has died
As they closed the door behind you
Whistle blows the turns of steel
Shake the ground beneath the wheels
As I wish I never found you
How can I be smiling when your gone?
Will I be strong enough to carry on?

I waited till my tears stop falling

My heart has had enough
I'm really not that tough inside
Baby

Lies
You have me had your lies
Come look into my eyes
Can't break my heart with honesty instead
Cause I don't want to cry
I'd rather say goodbye
Bye, bye
I can't take another lie
They told me not to trust in you
And finally I do believe this
Say who's the other man
You do the best you can to hide
Tell me
Does he think you're always beautiful as I did
The very first time I leave my eyes on you
I gave my heart to you
Again and again and again, baby

Keepin' both feet, on the ground

I'll go and sign my name across your heart

That girl's inside's are even now still in outer orbit
No love, no fate. It's unavoidable.
The music from the phone is a dose of stability.
Reception at the company, a narrow world.
Comparing the looks to the picture I painted is dizzying
Oh come on, this can't be...
I want to Continue once again.
Gleaming Neon, town where trash sparkles,
Old ignorant ears. Trusting in the proof
Checking the new song.
Disco is space. Dazed by you and your musky smell.
Floating in zero gravity, endless room, floatfloat.
Riding the planet that spins round and round,
We can go wherever, oh oh.
Riding the dazzling disco ball, let's go somewhere, even to Mercury
You say you once saw something out there, beyond it.
It twinkles and shines, between the stars when we dance until dawn.
I'll take you somewhere even more brilliant,
That boy that caught my eye, where is he tonight
I think that's the sound of clapping bursting out,
I wonder if I'll forget it tomorrow.
Plasma, a running flash of lightning,
I become giddy.
The glamor of silky black hair,
Lyrics like those I've heard somewhere before.
Where is the night that I don't know?
I want to see the morning that you know.
That girl had club events until morning,
He's within a dream all day,
Sunlight that intrudes without permission.
Returning from the club and secluding, inside my ear
Linked, from the ringing Snooze alarm.
Reversal, progress, on the best friend notice, is your name
Riding the dazzling disco ball, let's go somewhere, even to Mercury
You say you once saw something out there, beyond it.
It twinkles and shines, between the stars, when we dance until dawn.
Somewhere even more brilliant, I'll take you there.
Riding the dazzling disco ball, let's go somewhere, even to Mercury

359640,feel-the-pain,2007,the-genius-gza,Not Available,"I feel I'm a threat to high powered MC's
Cause when I roll up on their live shows they kinda freeze
From being approached by The Genius of rap
Whose poetry makes hands on a clock clap
You see, I be coming with strong rhymes galore
That even a stubborn MC can't ignore
That trying to defeat me brings about danger
Like a child speaking to a stranger
Soft MC's, I see more and more
With an ancient style, the prehistoric bore
Yes, they scream and roar until their throat get sore
Now they're running to the neighborhood drug store
To buy the cough drop for what? The wrong hip hop
Now they swear they're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop
POW!, now it's a six feet drop
For stealin' rhymes which is incorrect
Of those who speak on how others are weak
You wanna sneak peek of the hype technique?
Don't make me run up on start flipping like
I'm insane, or you'll feel the pain
I appreciate your comments of my creation
Your standing up followed by your standing ovation
Your kindliness to listen to the true MC
Those who know me make me #1 cause they agree
I rock on and on past the break of dawn
Ask Rakeem, Unique Ason, or even Melquan
Cause I be flowing at the same time showing
Hard headed individuals who don't be knowing
That I wreck it, cause my style was perfected
And injected into a drop beat selected
By who? Easy-Mo-Bee, the engineer
But don't forget the hypest in the Northern Hemisphere
The G, the, The G, the, The Genius
From Earth, not Mercury or Venus
Or Mars, cause then I'll be martian
But even in that world I'll still be squashin'
Brothers who feel they have the heart
To battle me, then I'll just trip them apart
Don't make me run up and start flippin' like I'm
Insane, or you'll feel the pain"
359641,words-from-a-genius,2007,the-genius-gza,Not Available,"Intro:
One two one two check one two
The Genius in the place to be
Verse One:
I make the mic pump my mic makes the party jump
And poison beats make hip-hoppers stump
their feet kinda wild, to give off sparks
But I'll still light it up when the place is pitch dark
Now that you witnessed me this get this correct, rap wreck
when I'm speaking it's the God projecting
facts into brains of those unaware
Now you're afacing the truth in the square
Bitties like biting, then yo you should chew this
Your man wants to beef, then we can do this
Then when it's time for you to face the God
I'll be giving you the whole nine yards
With lyrics that breaks the laws of gravity
So sweet to biters it gives them cavities
And can't be healer from the strongest toothpaste
So keep biting to see how the truth taste
You need guidance and self-assistance
Cause you lack the training to go the distance
But I'll rhyme, to the fullest length
And this is just a fraction of the strength
Chorus:
of the Genius
Words from a Genius
Verse Two:
I'll never sweat an MC then say I wanna be him
Cause he makes a hit records and flips a coliseum
I learn to lead myself, not be a follower
I'm not a biter, stupid rhyme swallower
I created something funky fresh funky new
Brothers started playing money see and monkey do
Should I explain hip-hop, okay I love it
Simple definition but ya still don't know the half of it
All I need is a mic, a beat, then I'll step free
And flip like I'm bugging off Bacardi and Pepsi
Dancers on stage like Alvin Ailey
While I'm deep into the roots like Alex Haley
You wanna try me, and be worn and torn
Step forward, I'll get on and start to born
A pumpin self explanator rap
Make a sucker MC like you clap
your hands, while you clap the sound's intact
You react like an infant respons to Similac
Or then again, could have been Enfamil
But for your information the rhyme is real
MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just One Nation Under
A Groove, getting down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the business for the junk of it
When I'm premitted to break down a poem
I'm like knotty hair rippin out teeth from a comb
One by one so who you calling your troops on
Ya couldn't even bust a grape, with spike boots on
Biters are crooks and try to steal the stage
I read em like books, flip em and turn the page
I'm The Genius, you're living in deep fear
Go home and write and come try me next year
With stacks of rhymes or you'll be feelin ill troop
You being stuck in the ice cream and didn't know the scoop
Chorus (2X)
Verse Three:
Some say The Genius, has a style of his own
And his hands are like Vise-Grips holdin a microphone
Flowin smooth, with rhymes that are rough
Because I can't get enough
So I practice not what I preach but what I teach
In which the critics say is improper speech
But it's proper, only to those who understand
Why I walk on stage with a mic in my hand
As brothers look on, label me as a psycho
Just because I'll jump on stage and grab a micro-phone
From a so-called said to be MC
Who admires me with jealousy and envy
My rhymes are delivered with style and potential
Words are flowin smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealin hidden tape records
Stuffed inside pockets and those I'll slaughter
But I don't get upset, when you bite and steal
I go home and write some ill
Stacks of poetry, page after page
Imagining the scen-ery onstage
I catch flash-backs of the seminar
As I crush the dreams of a wannabe star
Self-explanatory words are shifted
In a unbitten style cause I'm gifted
and talented, with the lyrical ability
Bound to fuck up a hip-hop facility
Damaging MC's who dare to enter
The center, then challenge the inventor
Of an impartial rhymin status
Followed a relevant apparatus
The way I come off on the mic is attractive
I can make a quadriplegic hyperactive
With lyrics of friction causing mics to spark
My style couldn't be bitten by a shark
MC's don't understand the way I be bombin em
Roll up and ask me what's the phenomenon
First of all homeboy when I'm battlin
I'm like a doctor shootin deadly insulin
Into MC's like that of a syringe
And dare you to seek for revenge

Built with Ghengis Khan, the wreck suede wiley Don
I judge wisely, as if nothin' ever surprise me
Loungin', between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like buildin' stones in Greece
My poems are deep from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the vision, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above clouds
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists, and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fits
I leave 'em split, like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips
Aiyyo, camoflouge chameleon, ninjas scalin' your buildin'
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to rage your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and it's the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black hebrew
The year two thousand and two, the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola Virus under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Un-loyal snakes get thrown in boilin' lakes
Of hot oil, it boils your skin, chickenheads gettin' slim
Like Olive Oyl, only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential, vitamin and mineral
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffin' clouds inside my pillow
Rollin' with the lands
The tribe's a hundred and forty four thousand chosen
Protons electrons always cause explosions
The banks of G, all cream downs a vet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see, my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax free shit by any means
Whether bound to hit scheme or some counterfeit cream
I learned much from such with cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like hams
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded, and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the limp on temp
With the stump, treat his hips like air pumps
RZA shaped the track, niggaz caught razor bumps
Scarred tryin' to figure who invented

When we perform we cause the Earth to shake
Ain't nothin' changes, it's still those same niggas
You love to hate GZA
I set examples over amplified samples
That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample
On those who fell victims, body loss they souls
These beats when I picked 'em
Jones played the role, soldiers brave and bold
RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls
Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by a new thief
The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in they pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time of the ridiculous rhyme
That's only excused by a generous mind
I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans
'Til I turned rap villes into harvested lands"

In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt

That's minimum, and feminine like sandals

Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon

I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink

Round the clock, that state pen time check it

Which was once on a downfall and then uplifted
So why live life foul when you're talented and gifted
I've changed, rearranged my total direction
Searchin' for happiness, seeking for perfection
Living the true life, a real story
To make you realize the truth, not scream Glory
Glory, hallelujah, not here to fool ya
But to replenish your souls as I school ya
With a greeting of Purified Education
Always Correcting Errors which stops the temptation
Of you doing wrong singing the same sad song
Renewing bad histories for how long
A Long long time ago
Going for mind made The Genius a pro
And as you see who I be
I be The Genius and thus a true M.C.
CHORUS
Brothers need to study some lessons"
359647,the-genius-is-slammin,2007,the-genius-gza,Not Available,"What I'm about to flow on is so dope
The average hip hop fiend couldn't cope
Or explain my style because it's hard to define
So the fiend scratch and think and nod to the rhyme
That I lay down in a straight narrow path
While beats are just flowin' off a modern phonograph
Bass loud, high hats crisp and clear
That'll never let a weak MC interfere
Or bring about some technical difficulties
So I got prepared and I wrote these
Rhymes That just broke loose from the brain
Searching for dope beats on the same plane
For you to write new rhymes it is a must
But I come off with rhymes old as dust
Even as a speck of dust it existed
Ya got that?
Forget it, ya missed it
CHORUS:
I'm slammin'
The Genius is slammin'
You flip me on the mic, no way
That's me being played in April on the 1st day
Now who's a fool? What do you strive for?
Prime time juice on the box and fans galore
Forget it, cause you're not hype as they want you
With a maximum of 200 your rhymin' IQ
Is 10, meaning thin, you'll never win
So erase that, I'm not gonna lose friend
I know you're gassed, ya charged, and kinda stuck up
But I define your challenge, a total fuck up
And it's critical, a crying shame
How many MC's challenge me, and die in vain
But you should've came with ya whole rap
Community, now where's your unity
Cause what I see right now is you and I
And you're too weak to stop me from doin' my
Damage, you know, type of body and fender
NAH!, not the same way I did Brenda
But you had the audacity to step to me
Thinking you was Butch Cassidy and you could do me
How can you do me when you don't know me
And out of the hip hop styles ya couldn't show me
One style that may have damaged me
But that's something you'll never see
CHORUS
M.C. means mic constructor I build
That have suckers running like what track and field
When I conduct please don't interrupt
With ya if's or and's or but's keep ya mouth shut
The hip hop style that I own is highly known
To bury MC's like a dog bury bones
And in this field, yo, I'm extraordinary
And in my back yard there's a cemetary
Of meek MC's who try to speak
And off preak technique that's soft and very weak
Yet they still have the heart to ask me to duel
And like Mr. T, I pity the fool
The shining chrome microphone is the device
That makes me stand out like men amongst mice
So respond to the stimuli then fly
Straight to the sky on a natural high
Cause I'm the transmitter buck wild and bitter
Thinking about tryingme then reconsider
Cause if it sounds tempting boy, I'll Double Dare you
And speaking of your low life, I won't spare you
Cause you're not worthy of the mercy
Anyway The Genius is just blood thirsty
So take a lickin' as the plot thickens
While ya head is took, ya be pumping like a chicken
How can you ever say my style was played
When my rhymes be chopping shit like a switchblade

Restaurant's on a stake-out so order the food to take out
Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed a wedding, late a fucking half hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contracting bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, bitches raise a grand to a finger
In the garment district, got it sewn like Singers
Cause all that talk blasphemy this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it, he turned state's on my nigga Castro this co-pilot
Who used to drop like stacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious custom made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man Muhammad from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern, bomb specialist
Initiated, at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half a key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singing, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game blasting niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives taking baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer and fifty immigrants with fake Visas

Yeah (yeah) yeah (Sham's nine times ultra)
Wu-Tang (herbs three times great, you heard of me)
Nigga, L.A.D. (six times ill)
Rest in peace O.D.B. (La the Dark, Sun large)
GZA, Ras Kass, yeah (what's up, Wu-Universal)
Legendary...
[Scaramanga Shallah]
Now it's the real beginning of the pages of Shams
Spit that heat rock, that make fiends make vapors of grams
Sham's is the Raiders fan, rock big cables of sands
Valleys and trunks, I got the mack ten
We can hit the alley with iron and thumper
Take it to the hands like the brand new linen
Niggaz goin' no mas, when the bullets go in him
You dealing with a night stick choker
The ice pick poker, trust, you ain't like this joker
And the set, devoted to opening your neck
With the tech, as you sit in a Lex'
Your next move, is slipping, your last move is shitting
As your body gets soft, the shotty went off
Little soldiers, you're out of position
Guns go off, Shams is a Raiders fan
A rob and gather reporter, columns are lost
White five, black five, with dollars to toss
Twisted by the dark side of the force
Black biscuit, by park side in a Porsche
You're off sides in the fort
We are survivors of the war of good and evil
I'm in the hood, in the hood with a desert eagle
With my Brooklyn peoples, now feel it..
[La the Darkman]
Darkman, my persona's like Tony Montana
How we used to sniff coke, how I puff marijuana
Try, play me today, I'mma kill you manana
From, far with the K, or up close with the llama
I'm like an African king in a castle in Ghana
Chest dripping with jewels, one hell of a rhymer
Study lessons in Athena, building with an old timer
So I, always been wise ever since a young minor
Get CREAM by any means, follow Malcolm X theme
So I'm often posted, in a window with that thing
Got a limited support from the Sing Sing regime
I'm Hannibal Smith and they like the A-Team
Keep my head on the swivel, when I serve a dope fiend
Upgraded, to a digital, from a triple beam
Fucking with me, you better be real as you can be
La Trapacanti, a well known rhyme general
[Ras Kass]
Whoever say Ras Kass don't spit fire, he a liar
That's like your favorite rap star claiming he gon' retire
When you mention me, not about penitentiary
Rims and rhyme skills, both twenty second century
Ahead of my time, school niggaz like Timbuktu
'cause I'm original, like blacks for larger jewels
Velour's by BUFU, Buy Us Fuck U
Try Us Fuck U. You die. Y'all got gats but him buck too, nigga
Sip Grey Goose and ponder. They know the room service
In Hotel Rwanda. reminder to honor these street scholars
Who ask why U.S. Defense is twenty percent of the tax dollar
Bush gave 6.46 billion to Haliburton
For troops support efforts in Iraq
Meanwhile, the hood is hurting, please believe that
The rape over, Cheney charging 45 dollars for a case of soda
Draining tax payers, eighty five thousand dollar oil filters (damn!)
But won't pay they soldiers, Haliburton workers make
Fourteen thousand dollars a month, privates earn thirteen g's a year
Plus a 25 extra taking fire in combat
Recruit all the niggaz, that die from where I'm at
18 years old, talking 'Kill, where Saddam at?'
But can't have a gat, to protect where my moms at
I love to crunk, so what. plus I'm gangsta enough
To piss in pimpin kids pimp cup. rack again and pump it up
How bitches still get fucked, niggaz just want a forty and a blunt
[GZA]
Yo, these youngsters they grow up on the block
With the product in they socks, and the fully loaded glocks
Too many die in vein, and it's a crying shame
The murders and the hustles, won't stop as they shoot for the top
Acquiring apparel, through growth and development
On they most dangerous missions, excuses were irrelevant
The brutality of war, never changes
And the out of control desire to win, makes it dangerous
Fire engulfed the set, they feel the threat, greater than
What they ever had, experienced yet
Indictments, sparked excitement, and the thrill to kill
Suddenly they felt the need for a challenge in they field
The great boundaries of both man and machine
Can have one at the point, to murder all in between
Yellow tape scene, dead teen, the mob was his idol
Giving a grim new meaning to the neighborhood's title, what's up?"
359653,highway-robbery,2007,the-genius-gza,Not Available,"[GZA]
An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move
A hog move, some rap cat on dog food
Microphone competition we devour
You pull plugs but take no source of power
Cause then in MCing, the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W U hyphen T A N G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that [shit], y'all niggas can't do [shit]
[Chorus 2X: Governor Two's]
Stick it up like it's a highway robbery
True gangstas we run New York City
We come fi takeover the industry
Cause you know them have fi too 'fraid of we
[GZA]
How come so much rap [shit] sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know

Brother's look, yo what he's gonna do
Hmm, you know I don't get too hyped
I just fully load up the brain and cock the mic
And blast off rhymes, within a matter of time
I'm like a mirror of organized crime
For slaying an MC who think that he might be
The first brother who could come up and fight me
Start running like you're looking for P.C.
Protective... custody
'cause I'm blowing off, just for going off
You may think I'm showing off, 'cause every rhyme is flowing off
A dope beat that is so sweet to the eardrum

Thirty-two degrees below zero

Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
But the way I speak is so poetic
Describe me on the mic, I'm energetic
Even if you roll up strapped with an uzi
Still your wack lyrics couldn't [Do Me!!]

You got germs, worms, plus a lack of respect
I'll be teachin, you couldn't handle

I cold turn it out, and yo then

I stomp em out just with supreme knowledge
Bustin up witches, yo I give stitches
Super-suckin-fuckin-lickin-some-sexy-scali bitches
I go off, and off men often
See the December's Primateen mist coughin

Bringin crazy static to your attic
Now I'm known to flip a show
Now who's your rhyming hero (4X)
You have some MC's who get too hyped
From a ten word rhyme it took em hours to type
That's not MCing, just an MC being
weak on his words and never thinkin bout freeing
Poitive thoughts that I let come out
I'm The Genius of this, I know what it's about
'cause on the mic I'm a leader, school I am a reader
When it comes to sex, a strong good breeder
MC's max but every one I wax
and collect the cash money without being taxed
Now that I have your attention, I'd like to mention
Don't battle me at any rap convention
If so I'll show all who wants to know
To detemine who's an amateur and who is a pro
Don't mean to get ill, 'cause I know how you feel

I met a young brother, how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him, and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeeahhhh boyyyeee, that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me
'cause we are the victims, of a situation
How wicked man, seperated
a nation and got us cold-killin off one another
(Word-word, to the mother)
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
'cause the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up, from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area
Cause everyday you're getting scarier
*blam blam* and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
'cause I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter, and out on the street
without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
about some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's, five, below and we're ex-pecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues?
About you can't get a job well go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not wonderama
But I'm talkin bout drama
Here what I'm sayin?
I'm not talkin bout your mama
Nahhhh, but I'm talkin bout drama

Put fire to my lung, tongue, teeth and gums
When it comes out my mouth, shit's hot and it burns
Make fools out of bitches like I'm Howard Stern

359658,mic-trippin,2007,the-genius-gza,Not Available,"[Genius]
Mic trippin, from rock skipping
Off the local brooks, not knowing
Heavy weight, throwin vocal hooks
Ryming off Apache, the Rza scratch thee
Records borrowed from Home Alone kid known as latchkey
Break beat fanatic, crates deep in attics
Forty-fives marked up, looped with static
Rap ring heavy, each link in my chain, trucks Chevy
Flare ripped from the magic lair, of medley
But deadly I merge foward, with a sharp spear
He must return now his flight departs here
Like Sittin Bull, I lay with my bow pulled
Arrow poisonous cos my enemy clip's full
Stay in the venue, with the party promoters, life parolers
Half the crowd wild, 9 m&m; holders
Apply boulders, smash your allied soldiers
Intimate footage roll off the cameraman's shoulder
Many-a-die for fame movin like Leroy
Can't be one and the same, nah it ain't b-boy
The decoy, scan this with high tech radar
Til my mic strike, leave a state-size crater
I came into this with the writer's block
To prevent a sudden shock, on a large flock
Clips are uncut episode, invinciable armor
I blaze one, once I struck the match off my bomber

Adjust this, til its EQ'ed like never
Watch a mega watt bang spot, raise the lever
Its operation cobra, its over
Control the globe slowly, the bold soldier
[Genius]
My rough cut metal tapes, quick to break labelmates
Won't hesitate to negotiate your table stake
First lesson came from the session, room one
From the longest awaited, but the strongest made it
Complex, complicated, compressed elongated
Homicidial sub-title, Wu claw banga off the ocean shore
Kid jaw, cut with the jig-saw
Intern engineer, vest on the youth
Make the mic booth bulletproof from sparked wires
From autofire, rapid from the verbalist slangster's gat
Two hit Tucker she labeled it gangstar rap
Unseen heard, struck the vital nerves
of some sort, courts got papers to serve
Still bang em in the head, just lead no eraser
One shot, no chaser, who gonna replace her
You punch-drunk swingin your keys on your index
Showin off your Rolex
Didnt see the joe text, you filmed it on bolex
Smashed with the largest full finger name ringer,life clinger

Mental flip, got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
You split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
When sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalizes the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryin' to think you can match this
The portrait's too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The feature Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We wrote block-tic checkpoints on your next joint
And who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed for killin' cascades
Throwin' bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spins
Counter on clockwise, still civilized
Kill spies on the wall that still flies all dies
Give no extension on the lynchin'
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show, see the promoted for the dough
I'm takin', breakin' his wax
Throw my shit on to perform my selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches
Underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reeds
The enemy walks above, Clan remain subterranean mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shatterin' bulletproof helmets with scrap nail fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thought that I propel
Through the North facility, the city must suffer at the hand
Of the Chief's command, volts is in
At 3 minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadenin' the power from electrical fences
Defenses are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound
{You know what I'm sayin'?
The God Cadaver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power)}
{And y'all cats don't know what it's about
(Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Killah Priest, come on}
Burnin' desire, ebony eyes, painted toe nails, legacys die
Winnin' by the well, Egyptian Queens, Arabian Sheiks
Paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows who stabbed they husbands
Sleepin' on silk pillows, blood on they robes
Disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolfs in black hoods, pull out they gats
Like magic wands, castin' spells, sendin' niggaz to Hell
Trappin' they souls in realms, baptize 'em with holy water
Springin' on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters
Silent nights over the dividers
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shoot outs, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files, describe them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dyin' saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it like the lost scriptures
Dissolve it with your 100 proof liquor
Ha, I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatenin' the lives of those who threaten me
Lessenin' my chances of defeat by predeterminin' the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my words shall be bombed
Regardless to anything or anyone or else
I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was livin' all along but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs change to cattle
Unable to [Incomprehensible] the Devil's [Incomprehensible]
Singin' at his eyes on the sparrow, mind narrow
2 positions, horoscopes and tarots
Hark harolds, angels and Christmas carols
Raven images hang from the mantels
Man made slaves and modern day babbles
Raw from Africa and golden ropes and sandles
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who man-handled us with leather whips and burnin' candles
And rambled through our castle, leavin' niggaz shambles
Stole our golden sodas like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
With to the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We went to Gretal and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand old daddy, have me
In mind, were they lost in this wilderness blind?"
359660,living-foul,2007,the-genius-gza,Not Available,"Such a shame, such a shame
Critical...
You're living foul, things are getting wild
It's difficult to raise a child
Cause growin up in a lost environment
Every day becomes a new experiment
Now we are faced with problems
But if we come together we can solve them
Before we start to solving, here's a sample
Who's coming foward to set the example
Inflation, starvation
Surviving takes a strong nation
Those who like to bring about static
Be aware of the true Asiatic
What you see was predicted before
We were already warned of this bloody drug war
Wherever you sell it wherever you go
Ya still being clocked by the cops, ya know
You're paid by the hours, they see time flies
While your brain's being showered by a bunch of lies
You say I'm no slave where's the lock and chain
Hmmm, on your ignorant brain
Skip to ya loo with your High Pro Glow
Ya not stim off life, ya stimulated off blow
Or the new improved, ask beaming Jack
Criza, criza, crack
Chorus: You're living foul, living foul
My people you were forced then brought
Stripped from your jewels brainwashed and then taught
To hate, deceive and dislike each other
Separating themselves, you're not my brother
Sit up at home for a mystery
Face-valuing things that you can't see
Can't taste can't smell, hear or feel
But senses prove everything is real
I'm here to present a positive way
If strong you'll accord if weak you'll stray
Drug users are stuck in the mud
Another 20th century modern day chud
These cannibal humanoid undernourished dwellers
Just took your check to the heroin cellar
Dope addicts, that walk and roam
Might have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, doesn't come from me
Cause I've studied and learned my history
It had to be something evil to bring that about
This is showing and proving beyond a shadow of a doubt
Chorus: You're living foul, living foul
When you wake up, to a brand new day
And you think about your salary or your pay
You think of negative things, should I get involved
Caught in crime, serving time, that's problems to solve
So you think about it, say that you must quit
Smoke a blunt, then you do the same old shhhh
And while ya high you don't truly know why
You spent your cash so that you can buy
Some herb (word) and some Old E (yeah)
A fifty cent Philly so the herb can be
Rolled up modern style to what we call a blunt
Know the facts is true don't try to front
Or stray away from the positive message in the song
That's only showing and proving you're not strong
And the strong is what we need today
Why? They go the opposite way
Chorus: Of living foul, you're living foul
The words right now flowing off my tongue
Is for the old, the young, the one's that's strong
Those who are worshippers of diamonds and gold
You should not be bought and you should not be sold
Those who always want but does not need
is slightly controlled by the hands of greed
If you rob, steal, backstab and abduct
Sooner or later you will self-destruct

You know we got the sess bones in the house
And, yo, God I'ma pass you the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, so I can rule the micraphone
Rakeem is feelin' lovely, word a pocket full of dough
A little drunk, reaction's mad slow
Thinkin', should I go to the club scene
And do what? And bag a rub-a-dub queen
Another thing, beyond the cream, I wanted to get ripped
Put my lips on a blunt tip
It's been two weeks, since I last sparked it
Went down to the club floors
Five dollar fee, plus ID
But a brother like me, gassed his way in for free
Word, took a bar seat
Got a tall glass, of sex on the beach
Turned to my left, saw this girl, she was slammin' sir
Ooh, what ya do, kid? I examined her
Pushed up, I tried to bag her, for her name
What happened? I didn't have the game
Overwhelmed by a scent in the air
Could it be? Yes, yeah, a potent bag of sess there
It was Raekwon and Loud Jerome
They had a bone, you mean a blunt? A palmetto
I said pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
They passed it, took one pull I was blasted
Felt kind of stimulated, fantastic
We approached the weak cypher
Did you surprise her? I tranquilized her
Bagged her, for her name and address
Slid to her rest, achieved mad success
But did you bone her? Did I bone her?
Did I bone her; you shoulda heard her moan
Pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Yo Genius, flip the micraphone
Yo, pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone so I control the micraphone
Yo check it
Outside a nightclub what? We shine some young bloods
Drinkin' forties right down to the suds
Ready to flow inside and rip the mic phone
Hmm, and all I needed was a sess bone
And guess who come down the block stumbling drunk
Ason, with two bags of skunk
Pull out the blunt put the weed inside
Roll it up tight, then the flame was applied
Inhale, but not pertaining to cough
Exhale, you know like two pulls and off
Stimulated kind of toxie
Seen a girl who was foxy, yo but she needed
Oxy wash, oh my gosh, yo not to disrespect
But back to the subject
The brothers rolled up on the scene that I had known
Smelled the skunk and said, ""Yo pass the bone""
I said, ""Lounge G there's not enough to pass around
So go get a bag from Uptown
I gave a pound to the brothers who was sweatin'
What about the Wisdoms? Yo they was stressin' me""
Hey Genius, Genius, when ya come do me
Step to me, you know screw me
Just another red bone, that I had bagged in the red zone
And took home to get my head flown
Forget about the weak cypher, so I slid to the back
Leavin' tracks of smoke stacks
That originated from the sess crops
Give me the mic and watch me get props
Pass the bone, yo, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone

Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin

Vocal imbalance, a code of silence converses violent
Live from medalion, ?nometry? dealin equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me, lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy, three-sixty degree
Complete the formation, salute the salvation
A Wu nation, do the knowledge no hatin
No misbehavin, lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin
Brain stainin, metaphor mutilatin
This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin
[Prodigal Sun]
A day and night crime scene, livin in the time machine
Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist

In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Cash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical, fuckin wit the abominal

Walking around with beepers and pagers
And who's beeping them? Oh it's the boss
Making sure no one is taking a loss
On his multi-thousand dollar operation
But how does he thank them for their participation
Whatever the pay, it's still not enough
Cause what they got into is some serious stuff
Hours a day back and forth on the strip
Sending customers far on a trip
And this roots of all evil brings about war
Cause you wanna open up another crack store
Children can't play in the parks and things
Because a stray bullet might be headed for the swings
You never though about that, oh I guess not
All you thought about was owning your own spot
To putting more and more people to sleep
But ya heading for a pothole six feet deep
You see the problem has gotten more serious
and the community is getting more furious
Get it deep in your head I told you so
It goes way beyond just saying no
Chorus: Stop the nonsense
Remember Steve with the blue Jag?
They found him cut up and stuffed in a bag
He had his own operation uptown
And there was plenty other drug dealers he would cut down
In other words he was living foul
Shootin up neighborhoods acting wild
He said he had to protect his drug trade
Which we manufactured throughout arcades
He made sure his enemies felt the pain
WHoever he felt was a threat, got slain
Like Donna, who was only sixteen
And she was employed on another drug scene
She try to set up a hit on Steve
But he sliced her throat until she could not breathe
This is what happens when you deal
You don't care on who you got to kill
I might walk outside and get shot
Because I live next door to a drug spot
And I don't need this stuff in my vicinity
Of me being shot for mistaken identity
This is the stuff that Steve was on
Now he's dead long and gone

Security's shining flashlights like where the weed at?
Stay in your place, see you guys smoke blowing in your face
And it's hard to stop it once we came to drop it
Who bold enough to challenge this deadly reportation
Of keeping MC's in a hopeless situation
No comparison, if you put the darts side by side
One will weigh out the other like friend next to brother
Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion
That structure that supported your rap started implosion
Your whole chest and your world caved in
They completely gave in, they just sparks and brave men

Or a snare with no kick, so you know it be authentic
Like the hand-made works of a carpenter
The 64 squares make 'em use a sharpener
Kept a fine point with the lead, then it's thread
On the paper then like cancer it would rapidly spread
This music is addictive but can't live without it
At times you shout it 'The Wu, they be about it'
A strong following with the die-hard supportedly
The loyalty came from the songs that went accordingly
I couldn't be more wrong if I changed the format
Did something different from the most explored rap

Not to play it is a terrible loss at whose cost?
People wait like never before for the ball to drop
At the gate lined up for a tape to cop
I still run into students banging my first joint
Wrote a essay off the second LP to prove a point
That a rhyme is a terrible thing to waste
Gimmicks and radio, the God don't chase
But I replace your wackness, it shows in your flows

Ya, raps need a clips that packed with lies
Cowardlessly ya shot up those innocently wise
In extra long verses hundred bars the lim'
The percentage of the truth in the rhyme is one tenth
A solid mass of minerals, easily broke down
Hard rock MC's ya nothin' but compound
Sparked by the endless greed of CEO's

That's where nature and nightmare come merge
Put ya hole in so much inside ya gotta splurge
On these snakes with the things that, poke through your denim
When ya move it accelerates the action of the venom
But the purity and sacrifice gettin' stung twice
From those who know dikes to cars that deep right

Considering my own future, I'm used to
Damaging MC's then pollyin' with producers

Hold, that song's playin' weak ass material

Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
I loved doing right but I was trapped in hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes and tears
Years of fears, but yo my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
And went to church since birth, but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was paying, plus the praying
I didn't like staying cuz of busy-bodies and dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up lookin at loot, butt, and thighs
Durin the service, he swallowed up the poor
And after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored, and explored my history that was untold
And watched mysteries unfold
And dropped a jewel like Solomon, but never followed men
Cause if you do your brain is more hollow than
Space oblivia, or the abyss
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb and blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
And from the caves he crept from behind
And what he gave, was the sect of the swine
When the bible, it condemns the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban, but now we're in the urban
No more wearing beanies and dress like a genie
No hocus pocus cause I focus on the facts
And put it on the tracks and brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
And too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home, or sell books by the market
Need to chill and get their mind revived
For years religion did nothing but divide

I strolled through the books of Job to unfold
And open bibles, instead of hoping on revivals
Calling on His name and screaming hallelujah
When he hardly knew ya, that's how the devil's fooled ya
See look into my eyes brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the bible I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied till my eyes was swollen, and only arose when
I found out that we were the chosen
I deal with the truth, and build with the youth
And teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
And women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz Son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted, and knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learned Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edom
The white image, of Christ, is really Cesare Borgia
And uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The Sixth of Rome, and once the picture was shown
That's how the devils tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man, but no one gave a damn
For my nation the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles, and some are plungin evils
So study and be wise in these days of darkness

What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
A neck full of gold, material things huh
That's what silly girls are made of
Verse One:
On a scale of one to ten I seen a girl about a nine
A slave of mental death of only she was divine
Walking down my ex-block, the block Munroe
I said, peace to her, the girl said hello
Well hell is low and the lowest you can go
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero
So I started to rain on this young girl's brain
Causin her a great mass of physical pain
She said, ""Tit for tat, step off my bra strap.
No diamonds, no gold, you cannot get a rap.""
Then I said, ""So what?"", as I grabbed her butt
She smiled for a while but her mouth kept shut
The girl is eighteen, just birthed a child
You're young in the brain and your thoughts are wild
You're on welfare, yo but you don't care
You say, ""FTF is always there.""
Yes FTF meaning face-to-face
The main headquarters of your local place
Where you collect your bi-weekly pay
To support the foolish habits you abuse everyday
Chorus:
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""Yeah that's right, I'm juicin em, I'm juicin em dry!""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
Verse Two:
There has never been a dame in my entire life
My girlie, my ex, my next or my wife
There has never been one who tried to disrespect
Especially a member of the opposite sex
Yo bust it, there's somethin that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Silly girls, they think guys are soft
But all they wanna do, is knock their boots off
And just from obtaining the common sense
You can tell that the girlies seem rather quite dense
Other than dense they play slightly bold
But from the statements I made they could not uphold theyself
They break down, and they start to cry and said
""Oh! I don't believe this guy!""
Chorus:
Now what are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""It's all about the finances"" ""Forget the romance""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""Guys with cash"" ""can rock my big a--""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
Verse Three:
Silly girls on a strip, struttin back and forth
Watchin cars, thinkin of G'n off
Lookin for gentlemen, who they might swing
And attitudes, like you can get anything
You wear tight bodysuits under long coats
But ain't satisfied until a pervert slice your throat
You're young you're dumb and you used to be innocent
when young, now take a look at what you've become
A bloodsucker, trying to get all you can
Out the pocket of thenext girl's man
Just to clothe yourself in gold and jewelry
You wear tight jeans with attempts to lure me
Into your web, cause you're livin like a spider
And playin it off, like everything's Oreida
You come out late at night and roam the streets
like thiefs, stalkin a piece of flesh meat
Is that what you do for a living get paid?
C'mon, there's plenty of ways to get paid
But instead of living the life that's clean and sturdy
You'd rather go out and get your knees dirty
Chorus:
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
""He better buy me some gold bamboozles"" ""And some Fendi too""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
What are silly girls made of made of
What are silly girls made of
First of all, don't leave home without it
Without what?
The gold card
I'm tryin to tell you now
I don't lay on my back for free
You know as they say
If you wanna Taney
Ya gots ta pay
Yo what's up gorgeous, what's your name?
Baby let's talk about your assets first
Alright baby, well let's go for a ride in my new car
What kind of car you drivin baby?
I got a new Yugo
A Yugo? C'mere
You go, get in your Yugo
and get on out of here!
Girlfriend, tell him about hisself
I don't believe him, he got champagne thoughts and Bud Light money
Bud Light money? A Yugo? A thirty-five hundred dollar car?
And you steppin to this? I take only Benz's and better love
Forget about the love it's all about the money

But in this everyday a homeboy dies
Whether shot in the body or cyanide in ya Bacardi

And if I score, I'll increase the murder rate

Set them up, now they suffer the loss
Of he or she who's ever on the agenda
Most likely a family member
Informants, rattle-tattle-telling snakes
Get shot up, brutalized and thrown in lakes
The parts of a body is found days later
The other half was done by an amputator
I'm undefeated in plenty fights
My enemies are beaten with many stripes
I'll shoot up funerals, firebomb wakes
Vehicular homicides, whatever it takes
Just to keep control of my empire
I'll set ya own mother on fire
'Cause when it comes down just to me and my money
Ain't a fucking thing funny
All those who pose a threat I'll stick them
Ya friends, ya family and innocent victims
Get caught in the midst when I'm busting of nines
But they was in the wrong place, the wrong time
Decapitated bodies found in lots
While I'm still cooking up kilos in pots
The kilos becomes bricks and the bricks becomes rocks
Then retailed on the blocks
I drive around in expensive cars
And get women who fuck like porno stars
I get them high, you know, like powder they nose
Then put 'em in the streets as my high-class hoes
I'm wild, living foul and I'm ruthless
I leave muthafuckers toothless
I had a worker who stepped on the scene lively
Then started selling my customers Ivory
Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks
I stuck 'em to death with a thousand thumbtacks
You've seen my resume, that's just the half
I'm a bad muthafucker, just like Shaft
A character played by who? Richard Roundtree
The only difference, my guns are sound-free
Silencers ring off then wisp by
Then all you hear is a last minute cry
Of those who triedto control my territory
Not the West Side but the Bed-Stuy story

For an 8th grader, my style was kinda fly
And just to prove I was an MC Pro
I often sponsored a classroom show
And the hype part of my imagination
Was making my homeroom a hip hop station
Minutes before the late bell would ring
I would greet the audience and then I'll swing
A lyric or two as the students barked
Beacuse my rhymes had sparked
Off somethign causing the class to mingle
To a rhythm which is now a 12"" single
Letting off many styles of hip hop
Holding the mic that I made in wood shop
Forget gold, my key chain was a cable
Two math textbooks were turntables
And for a mixer, something much cooler
A penny being cross faded on a ruler
Measuring dope beats that were flexed
From hands that played a drum roll on a desk
From my home girl, her name, fly as Emory
Sweet memory
I remember sitting in my art class
Drawing up lyrics kinda fast
The outcome, a masterpiece
Live shows with hyped up rhymes released
As if lyrics were flowing from the heavens above
I'll grab a mic and provoke a push to a shove
From boys and girls who broke necks to see
The lyrics G.O.D.
Those were the days
Now it's high school, lunch room's the scene
And I'm ready to flip the routing
In the cafeteria, period three
And here I come with the JVC
I go in my pocket and pull out a mic
Plug it in, check one-two...alright
Now who wanna show and prove their MC skills?
A brother stepped forward and tried to get ill
But when it came time to live out his name
He kicked rhymes that all sounded the same
But I did him in with a matter of time
And he was done with one victorious rhyme
He was shocked because he knew he was rocked
Along with his classmates from off his block
YO!, I'm telling you, I flipped his whole crew
One against one or one against two
Or three or four brothers who swore they can rhyme
Battled me and got taken out every time
From my style and my dope profile
Plus the period of time that I rocked for awhile
As a motivated, dominated supreme force
Cultivated, activated cream and source
The wise educated and born to be
The one who would flip an MC

She dated jolly green GIANTS, that, flew on JETS
An A-list actress, who was never walked off sets
She loved stuffed animals, especially BEARS
Was a role model, like a CARDINAL to our peers
A PATRIOTIC tomboy, like Mary Ellen from The Waltons
A former lifeguard, who had the skills of a DOLPHIN
When I met her, she was in drama school and wore BENGALS
Drove a BRONCO, and she was far from star spangled
Had basic skills, and worked part time in mills
Raised buffalo's, cause she was behind them BILLS
Had a man who always roared like LION
A domestic violent cat, tackled the girl and kept her crying
Couldn't care, she was losing her hair, from depression
She was in the air, and there was some room for interceptions
I told her to stay strong, not to be ashamed
You're a ""ten-i-see"", you just need to TITAN your game
Her ancestors were CHIEFS, who ran with running deer
On the sail with the SEAHAWKS, who battled the BUCCANEERS
The REDSKIN garments, was suede coat liners
Held rare coins, frequently sought from gold miners
They were hard working warriors, we call over timers
Shot plenty arrows at COWBOYS and 49ERS
Her interesting background, but quite unusual
A great force grip, but out of bounds for a musical
She told me to call her, if I came to town
I started TEXAN her, soon as my plane had touchdown
Holding my luggage, in the hand that revealed the bad scars
She pulled up at arrivals, driving the JAGUAR
Her BROWN skin was soft, her legs beautifully shaven
Her house was fly, sitting on the roof, was a RAVEN
As we entered, I heard laughter
She walked into a large living room, I went after her
There was two of her, girlfriends, playing chess like they were VIKINGS
Militant as PANTHERS, they're resemblance was striking
Had on thongs, high heels, and belts that was garter
Energized like phones that just came off the CHARGER
I introduced myself to gain yardage
'cause anything less then smooth, would of been straight up garbage
The shorter one met me, when I had a sky pager
Thought I rolled with robbers, STEELERS and panty RAIDERS
She took fruit from the orange bowl, it was in season
One of them said she loved the juice and kept squeezing
I knew that I was gonna get, wined and dined
It would of been a penalty, not to pass the scrimmage line
Now I laid back and relaxed, waiting for the kick-off
One removed the lip gloss, like she was bout to lick all
She caressed me, with fingertips soft as velvet
Dying for me to PACKER, as she stroked my helmet
And I was thinking these girls was SAINTS
But it was first and ten, and there was extra walls to paint
Before you know it, I had all three in a huddle
Buckin' like a COLT, before I released them puddles
They spread EAGLES like wide receivers
As I RAM them in the endzone, and they became true believers
[Outro: movie sample]
I be liking chess
'cause chess is crazy, right there, that's the ultimate
It's like a great hobby right there, playing chess
The board, the pieces, the squares, the movement
You know, war, capturing, thinking, strategy
Planning, music, it's hip-hop, and sports

Intro: (first three lines LP only)
I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in...
Babies crying brothers dying and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
in this cold, cold world...
Verse One: The GZA
It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fuckin projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck, by enemies who put fear
and blasted on the spot before the pigs were dere
You know hoods robbers snipers new in sight fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fuckin lights
Gunshots, shatter first floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether broke callisthetic, any style you set it
Beat niggaz toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
and squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Destruction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggaz catch slugs
and pockets dug from everything except check stubs
and it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggaz layin on roof tops
for his CREAM he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
you don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
drop those who act like thai flows from Mexican
Rabbit, like recipients cashin checks again
Back to the motherfuckin spot on Lexington

Babies crying brothers dying and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down

Stick up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scramblin for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learnin fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggaz main concern is CREAM
Some niggaz in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese resteraunt, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid
and hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled
Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passin off cash
Extortions, for portions of streets, causes beef
Havin followers of Indians trying to play Chief

of a modern day opera, where the main character

Ahead of time, competition not even half close

Prematurely brought to play, I'll never allow you
To strike first, so precautions must be taken

It's a shame when the sixteen bars are just a waste
And every line or word, is badly placed
Even dealing with the narrow window of time
My arrangements, are quick, shutting down your power lines
On a bunch of small puppets, with a wack ass team
That only move, at a push of a button that pull strings
Bad boys move in silence, secretly fading in
Unlike fake gangstas and ya wannabe made men
Acting like they carry the gun that killed Lincoln
Or they rolling with two hundred murderers from Kingston

Just the caters of the verbal expressions, self explainin'
Were my boots out in constant walks across the borough
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop
Cause M.C.'s be more shook then the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven
Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'
I walk Broadway, from Quincy to Myrtle
Back to Quincy, cut careers whatever the expense be
They heard the Legend, run to the reverend
With headaches and blackouts, worse then severe seven
And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
'Til it's understood
We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks
At times we play legendary battles on tapes
Unlikely confrontation with a clash of swords
In a G that was stored, be rain that just poured
On cats and dogs, water that, flooded the stance
The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead
A hand full recovered from the dramatic plunge
While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slaked them in a scrimmage
He continued tarnish that, already faded image
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke
Like too many tokes, that'll recharge in growth
This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game
With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage
My other's hard to vanish, punishment, swift to sudden
Unparalleled advantage, brought to a level where you froze and can't speak
Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak
And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood

359679,superfreak,2007,the-genius-gza,Not Available,"I hopped on the train and cold clocked a chick
Who looked good as hell but she appeared to be sick
I would say she had to look as if she swallowed a worm
Then again she could've swallowed several ounces of sperm
Giving me the eye as if I was the right antidote
So I decided to swing a smooth episode
While the train stopped at Grand Central turn
Before I knew her name I was massaging her perm
I said, ""My you look drunk, have you been drinkin alcohol?""
You got a fever here's an Extra Strength Tylenol
She said, ""Great a comedian, comic""
She leaned on me, I said, ""Please don't vomit!""
She said, ""I'm not I just need some rest""
I said, ""A few more stops, The Genius house is best""
Got to my rest, her whole attitude change
But deep inside, she seemed sexually strange
Went in the room and she flopped on the bed
With wild-ass thoughts inside her headachish head
I went in the kitchen to prepare some food
When I came back in she was completely nude
I know it sounds weak but believe it or not
That the fever in her head ran straight to her twat
She was burning! Burning up out
It took more, than firemen, to put that out
And yo, I was hard, just as hard as a rock
That I can hit a home run, with my cock
She said, ""Let me show you what we do uptown
I huff and I puff till I blow your balls down""
Wild as a wolf from off Wilderness Ave
She said, ""My what a great big ahhh! you have""
I started dripping and dripping in consecutive terms
I know we must save water but that does not include sperm
Did you ever know a girlie who just loves to switch
From a Part Time Lover to a Part Time Bitch
While she's loving part time, she's riding on mine
She says, ""I love you long as you keep making me feel fine!""
In her behind, vagina, or heated climax
That I would sew, control, finger then wax
Now she's swingin so low yo she flex like wrecks
'cause she can set records on oral sex
There's no lie what I said, she lives in the bed
If she got married, she'd be a worn out newlywed
And if she heard these words yo she would not cry
Because sperm, the only damn tears in her eye
Her drip-drop face is the one I painted
Just stared in her eyes while she damn near fainted
As she choked, goggled, then spit up
'cause cream, was flowing, all over her cup
On the bathroom floor 'cause her parents were home
And I just could-n't tolerate her moans and groans
""Genius, oh Genius, oh rock me so hard!
'cause I don't want to stop, I love you God!""
But there's one thing she could never erase
That the thing she really wanted just sprayed in her face
So she regret, she ever swung low before
But this little hot bitch comes swingin for more
It used to be one, now it's five fingers of death
That rips her insides, as she gasp for breath
To say, ""I love you! I love you! Forever so!
I'm getting hot getting hot let me blow let me blow""
What she thought was love, turned out to be lust
That made her live by the laws, in sex we trust"

Then I began flowing in a smooth steady motion
Cause I'mcontended to know that I've invented
Poetry which has been highly complimented
Thus how I rhyme is what I feel on stage
And from a fraction of a thought I can write a whole page
I'll just pull a notebook from off the shelf
And like Salt-N-Pepa I express myself
To make most of you know me, and some of you don't
But when it comes to cold challenging, I bet none of you won't
Arrange a battle, improve your style
Against a brother with a totally different profile
Most of you flake cold front ya flex
And hesitate on rhymes that should've been Memorex
But you forgot I remember you're an amateur
Mystery worshipper, nowI prefer
ThatI remind you or tease ya on who's the boss
Cause you suffer amnesia, that's memory loss
Well get this just as quiet as it's kept
MC's on the chart from teh start has slept
Let's shake them,wake them, they should be woke
For what? They take MC'ing for a practical joke
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just as phony as ya wanna be
You present yourself to be the quiet storm
You're a sneaky littlesnake in a devilish form
But as they say, yo, to each its own
And to each one who plays with a microphone
Abbreviate microphone and M.I.C.
Meaning what, Myself, I, you see
I invite those to battle me then they're through
Bust it, i'mnot prejudiced you're invited too
The rap convention or the MC show
I have rhymes to block those who hit below
The belt, that means biting a rhyme
Yes, I'll wax you, tax you and plus save time
Now who is known to uphold his own
And words are heard like a strong baritone
Freestyle techniques that's wild and bold
That'll smile in your face and still come so cold
That I'll freeze you to the point of non-defrost
Now you're trapped in the Land Of The Lost
Should I, could I, would I lose
When it's a selfish sore loser like you I choose
To roll your big eyes and suck your buck teeth
Because you're upset that you ever caused beef
Yo homeboy, I never meant to tease
But it's a slaughter, can someone help him please
Feeling uncomfortable, then loosen your belt
Once The Genius gets heated up, suckers will melt
Then after ya melt, ya start dripping like water
Then you can say this was a Goddamn slaughter
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just phony as ya wanna be
Ain't no rhymes like the one I got
They put competitors in a trance, y'all
Radio stations ran them a lot
They made children play and dance y'all
How dare ya mention you're an MC
When the crowd disagrees on who claim to be
Cause your battle piece are the rhymes you release
And that only make the crowd boos increase
Hey, may I say I'll stay a DJ
MC who try to defeat me or portray
One who claims he gain much respect
But in a battle, straight up and down ya getting wrecked
Cauise getting with me is definitely a slaughter
Or diving in a pool head first without water
So don't set yourself up to get brutalized
That only happens when you're not energized
Bit I'm so damn energized, I'm energetic
That I can wreck a microphone 'til it's pathetic
Oka, got it in your head, correct
That I'm victoriouson any subect
You disbelieve, then huh, call the title
Then after one rhyme you'll be calling me your idol
It's like..zap...another one on my jock strap
Now you walk around praising my name
Cause i'm slamming and I make you feel the pain
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just phony as ya wanna be"

Far removed from this hip hop life, off course
But the confidence and resilience was never lost
In the think thank and research lab, I laid tracks
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back

From the father and the chemical contents of the sun

Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter

Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A storm with no warnin' you're drawn in, environments
Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debris
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an MC
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar
From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circle of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder
Filled with cult for slaughter
Meaning the contracts manifestly work
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
In spite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance
On his target through a crowded market no interference
The microphone left on the scene without a serial
Evidence consistent with organic material
Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree
Till it spread widely
Now who's the man who brought you the legend of the liquid swords?

That vacate your vessel
Guide this, strenuous as an arm wrestle
Move swift as light, a thousand years in one night
Then flight with insight
Everything i thought of, I saw it happen
Then I rose from the soil to sun blacken
Then came rao czars, left tracks and scarred
A pair of brightness of exploding stars
Gave me goods to taste
No ingredients to traced
And remained stuffed trying to figure the shape of space
No edge or boundary, released 2 rounds or 3
Intimidate my razor scrape, phony clown MC
The physical shatter from the blast
Pierclastic flow sets of a tower of ash
Through ignorance and misplaced trust your world's crushed
Too late to activate hyperspace of thrust
Even wearing camoflauge the analog at war

The father came in accompianed by deadly rain and when
Mentally indowed when lighting hit the crowd

This is a tale of a town with the population
Of approximately two thousand people
They small close in their community with crime
And murder, we're virtually unheard of
With front doors, were always left unlocked
A place where mayhem only happens in your wildest dreams
Boy...
[GZA]
For some, the sun will never come out tomorrow
Like those in this heart pounding tale of random horror
Of a body count, after trashin' it, they done with it
Victims inflicted with passionate punishment
Specific offers of horrific torture
That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers
This ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down
Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town
Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked
Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks
As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney
So his child passion became a life long journey
Grew into a world of destruction, abduction
Left many body parts flowin' on the Hudson
Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched
Screams is high pitched from scars you can't stitch
Mutilated and decapitated, white collar chicks
Just from his involvement in local politics
His outfit stained with the blood of the slain
While his backyard full of skeletal remains
His goal in life, was preparation for death
An autopsy showed affixation, loss of breath
Was it his fascination, for strangulation
The lynchings in the '20's was his inspiration
Unspeakable acts that made front page
Motivated by an unexplainable rage
[Interlude: samples]
""A suspected killer plaguing this community
Has once again eluded police and detectives""
""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""
""This nameless, faceless murderer
Has killed a couple, execution style, in their own home
Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat""
""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""
[GZA]
The State psychologist, forensic pathologist
Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious
They ruled out the possibility that the killa be
Physically fit with athletic ability
Talley and murder, on his agenda
There was no word, and it's code for ""surrender""
So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion
Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion
Compellin' evidence, statements from residents
Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence
From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire
The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva
DNA directly linked to the psycho
Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0
For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved
A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve
The bullets had names that made the frames shatter
Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter
Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime
Made a hard discovery from one of many signs
While questionin' a man he picked up on a scanner
He reacted in a loud and agitated matter
And once they tried to read him his rights
He turned cold as ice"

Welcome to the Jungle where the cat loves to scratch
The rat squeals
And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles
Here the leopards grab the wilderbeast down by it's tail
You see the chimps they grow hips they hustle and sling in trees
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk
Or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra
He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet
Now you're neck deep in depth with a bunch of lone sharks
So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees
The tick moved with the fleas
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough
See a million mosquitos from the West now
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild

Out of fear of the deer watch for the eye of the tiger

The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved
And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist
And the bats use their sonar to guide and a**ist
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail
The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes
That use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes
While the black widow laid a web for the bachelor
Like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula
They both prey on gra**hoppers beetles and flies
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies
What costs little, is a little worth
So some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf
From birth they grow up walking the thin line

Men who looked soft but actin' wild
Dancin' to the beat, Ten City style
Females who wore jeans that were tight
With faces resemblin' transvestites
Everyone in the bar gave my girlies mean looks
As if they were fugitive crooks
They smiled at me and the God, showin' all 32
That's when I caught the clue
As this redbone, who thought she looked fly
Rolled up on me, and she said hi
That one little word fucked up the whole night
Her voice was deeper than Barry White
I jumped up and boy, did I flip
I pull out a nine and I empty the clip
The place was flowin' with crazy blood
A little Midtown massacre type flood
And as we stepped off from the scene
Here's the message I got from Rakeem
Stay out of bars
Stay out of bars
Stay out of bars
Stay out of bars
Stay out of bars

I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did and for don'ts, I said, ""I won't""
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn and ripped up
Stripped up, shacked up and backed up from fiends
'Cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slingin' in my lobby, little Steve and Bobby
Gettin' paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide and seek
The fiends seek for the crack and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say, they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic so fuckin' hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Coulda wrote a book with a title
'Age 12 And Goin' through Hell'
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol
Stickin' up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid, come home from doin' the bid and nuthin' changes
What is the meaning of crime
Is it criminals robbin' innocent motherfuckers every time?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Tryin' to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like the umpire
But it's an everlasting game
And it never cease to exist
Only the players change
So I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
I gotcha back but you best to watch your front

Chaos, outside a spark steakhouse
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga Mr. Wedding, late a fuckin' half hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contractin' bricklayin jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, bitches raise a grand to a finger
In a garment that's stretched, got it sewn like Singer
'Cause all that talk blasphemy this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington Coat Factory
Fuck it, he turned snake so my nigga Cash stole his copilot
Who used to drive like sacks of blow on this remote
Area, we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got the various custom made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man Muhammad from Afghanistan
Grew up in Iran, the nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern, bomb specialist
Initiated, at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork, niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half a key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, comin' through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand singin, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game blastin' niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives takin' baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five, that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule, anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from the interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processin' plants for the call of Costa Rica

Two hundred pounds of reefer
And fifty immigrants with fake Visas

It was the summer of '77.
NewYork was just recovering from the raves due to the blackout.
HipHop was young and growing rapidly, it was during that time when my father would oftent make journeys accross waters. From Shaolin on his [not clear?] to where many say this art form started. The ferry, or the boat, as most called it, was a floatin' forum, for talent especially MC's, who would often battle while in route to the city. It was on the boat, where he would sharpen his sword on neighborhood MC's, preparing for the battles that were soon to come..."

Heavy foot traffic jam the hallway all day
Adolescence workin for small pay
World so little, he could never leave his block
His home full of riddle, so he always need his glock
He coast with his eye open, keep his metal smokin
Young wasted minds, fiendin on dimes, cokin
Forgot kids quick to break rules, and known to make fools
out of many, down the streets be more safe than school
There's no diploma, that can break him from the coma
A bloody war in the country, the youth hungry
On the corner, hyenas amongst me
Yabbin bout the stories, they be hearin, always swearin
Can't even spell the shit that he be wearin
Caught up in the silk web of material
Superficial stains ya brain tissue, that's the issue
The young is lost at their own cost, dreamin
Screamin how we never hold positions, that's the meanin

The elderly shake their head in disbelief
and no relief came till I aimed

on torn down blocks, drug spots set out their shops

some funny niggaz act like they could pop glocks and those who can't cop
Sisters givin up ass a lot, brothers givin up cash a lot
They be strugglin to become someone because their parents not
Just another victim of the ghetto, where lost minds settle
When the devil uncivils society and die free
With double 'W' followed by J-D around the necks
and wrists the God is now a dog, the earth is called a bitch
and all my people wish to get rich in this wilderness
To push a lexus, ice on everythin from rings and braclets to the necklaces
Children molested within these pest infested buildins
Thieves uneducated in these schools, paint on the ceilins
Peelin off, but all I see is lost black babies callin
""Please somebody save me, please somebody save me""

Knowledge this wisdom, this goes back when I was twelve
I loved doin' right but I was trapped in Hell
Had mad ideas, sad eyes an' tears
Years of fears but yo, my foes couldn't bear
I searched for the truth since my youth
An' went to church since birth but it wasn't worth the loot
That I was payin', plus the prayin'
I didn't like stayin' 'coz of busy bodies an' dizzy hotties
That the preacher had souped up with lies
Had me cooped up lookin' at loot, butt an' thighs
Durin' the service, he swallowed up the poor
An' after they heard this, they wallowed on the floor
But I ignored an' explored my history that was untold
An' watched mysteries unfold
An' dropped a jewel like Solomon but never followed men
'Coz if you do, your brain is more hollow
Than space oblivia or the abyss
With no trace of trivia, left with the hiss
Does it pay to be deaf, dumb, blind?
From a slave we was kept from the mind
An' from the caves he crept from behind
An' what he gave was the sect of the swine
When the Bible, it condemned the pig
I don't mean to pull your hems or flip your wigs
But we used to wear a turban but now we're in the urban
No more wearin' beanies an' dress like a genie
No hocus pocus 'coz I focus on the facts
An' put it on the tracks an' brought it through the wax
I speak on Jacob, it might take up some time
An' too much knowledge, it might break up the rhyme
I did it anyway just to wake up the mind
Of those who kiss stones or prays on the carpet
Those who sit home or sell books by the market
Need to chill an' get their mind revived

An' open Bibles instead of hopin' on revivals
Calling on His name an' screamin', Hallelujah
When He hardly knew ya, that's how the Devil's fooled ya
See, look into my eyes, brethren, that's the lies of a Reverend
Why should you die to go to Heaven?
The Earth is already in space, the Bible, I embrace
A difficult task I had to take
I studied 'til my eyes was swollen an' only arose when
I found out that we were The Chosen
I deal with the truth an' build with the youth
An' teach my son as he kneels on the stoop
Son, life is a pool of sin, corrupted with foolish men
An' women with wicked minds, who build picket signs
To legalize abortion, the evil eye distortion
I quiz son with my wisdom
Before I converted, I was perverted an' knowledge was asserted
The study of wisdom, I preferred it
The understanding, it gave me mental freedom
I even learnt Caucasians were really the Tribe of Edam
The white image of Christ is really Cesare Borgia
An' uhh, the second son of Pope Alexander
The sixth of Rome an' once the picture was shown
That's how the Devil's tricked my dome
I prophesized to save a man but no one gave a damn
For my nation, the seed of Abraham
Blessed with the tongue of Hebrew
Now we're strung on needles an' some are plungin' evils
So study an' be wise in these days of darkness

And microscopic optics received through the boxes

Penitentiaries is either half-dead or too sweet
Back to basic, condition-al god, plus I can take it
Wagin war within the matrix, it's hard to see
Touch, hear, smell or even taste it, take your places
We runnin in these human races, bucking naked
Back-slappin kid yappin, actin villian catchin feelin like we cap peelin
As if we killin every brick in every project building

'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

For do's I did and for don'ts, I said, ""I won't""
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn and ripped up
Stripped up, shacked up and backed up from fiends
'Cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slingin' in my lobby, little Steve and Bobby
Gettin' paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide and seek
The fiends seek for the crack and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say, they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic so fuckin' hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Coulda wrote a book with a title
'Age 12 And Goin' through Hell'
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts
Back on the Ave of Lavonia and Bristol with a pistol
Stickin' up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid, come home from doin' the bid and nuthin' changes
What is the meaning of crime
Is it criminals robbin' innocent motherfuckers every time?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Tryin' to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like the umpire
But it's an everlasting game
And it never cease to exist
Only the players change
So I gotcha back but you best to watch your front
'Cause it's the niggaz who front, they be pullin' stunts

Where unskilled skaters, couldn't figure eight twice
At sixteen uncut, direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result, death by the bolt
In a vote, it spoke about the average loss commission
That was seen by a King in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with con cash
It kept the jury quiet and now a riot will form
While satanic man, now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Boost ya ratings but hypes behind casualties
Fire shots, for low-pressure water gun play
Instantly, slap ya fire like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool from the elements
The Earth use and built it to a complex
Network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle through enemy observation
Swarmin' unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the force significantly, change the error
Check my wind pattern, it's headin' West
Success is freedom bur failure could mean death
Humans sweat, aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent, damage caused by the double U
Now who cowardly urge you to merge through
And think the workers'll serve you
Signin' marvel, who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, practically marred in marble
His accountless, amount of MC's I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our world is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Change the race by reason and ashes just the wind
The left is so our breathin', keep ourself from givin' in
Yo, love and hatred, home is most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas workin' for the Feds
Sent out secretly to take my head
I lay back and meditate to the words they say
Skip town for a mutten goofy dred
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Return at the last fall of the autumn leaves
Operate the plan accordingly, in case the Feds are recordin' me
Sign all documents, usin' forgery 'cuz just a near thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly
Told the word I'm black and calmly
Howls from the grave haunt me
The smell of death's upon me, I dwell in the hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old Kings
Who sold everything on a quest for god's divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times when the moon lit and the sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walked the vacant districts for four religions, studied Pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on a cure missions
Who harden their hearts to ward the weak, sick and afflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her, soft cause hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hold on to hell
Embracing her was like embracing a third world
Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our world is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Change the race by reason and ashes just the wind
The left is so our breathin', keep ourself from givin' in

Anything from 220 to 140, that's mine
Y'all need to step the fuck off
Y'all niggas ain't crazy for real
Yo, the fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
I'm deep down in the back streets, in the heart of Medina
About to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
Under the subway, waiting for the train to make noise
So I can blast a nigga and his boys,for what?
He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock
I had a connect to cross-sales, to catch more mill's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills
I'm in the park setting up a deal over blunt fire
Bum nigga sleeping on the bench, they had him wired
Peeped my convo, the address of my condo
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe
And while we set up camp, we got vamped
Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart
Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee
Blown out the frame like Pan Am Flight 103
He got swung on, his lungs was torn
A kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
A regular on the block that played lookout
For playing predator with a Glock, he should have took out

There is no clip that's full enough

Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
It's mandatory that I supply all my troops with mega firearms
Big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
To get cream, sometimes they repaint the scene
Like the last episode on gates, and other niggas
Plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
And flows through, all they knew, he's gun sick
His Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors
Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organized his crime and drug wars
Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
No neighborhood is rough enough
There is no clips that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload

There is no niggas that's fuck with us

Woodwork strips being chipped with sharp chisels.
One verse shatter your spine and crush your spirit
No matter what, you still Window Shop for lyrics

And if those your soldiers, give 'em bigger guns to hold

A few cats is lookin' for a rat with cheese
Got somethin' to pitch? They all swing a bat with ease
Get your ankles broke while doin' your two-step
Leave a Thank-You note for the crutches the Wu left
Proactive rap, you know they put drug in the cream
You hallucinate, see Kanye in your dream
And yo, I don't smoke dust; I dust off Smokey and the Bandits
With the brush stroke off the canvas

Raise the lynx that was killed for your minx, you be rockin' in Blizzards
Wanna be cock (diesel)'til you walk the D-Block
To get a transfer, I'll spread your wings like Peacocks
I was an emcee while you was in Nutville
On a world tour, you was gettin' your guts spilled

Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in
Babies crying, brothers dying and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block
And you got me locked down in this cold, cold world
It was the night before New Year's and all through the fuckin' projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outside as I'm stuck by enemies who put fear
Blasted on the spot before the pigs were dead
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fuckin' lights
Gunshots, shatter first floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether broke callisthetic, any style you set it
Beat niggaz toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made 'em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Destruction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hangin' from his Farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggaz catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggaz layin' on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoe box
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashin' checks again
Back to the motherfuckin' spot on Lexington
Babies crying, brothers dying and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block
And you got me locked down in this cold, cold world
We be runnin' from the cops, bustin' off shots
Shit is deep on the block
And you got me locked down in this cold, cold world, yo
No time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Clicks control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape, barricades, sidewalks, where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock, midnight
Stick up kids on the ground, broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scramblin' for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learnin' fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
'Cause niggaz main concerns scream
Some niggaz in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed a kid
And hit a twelve year old girl in the head and then fled
Tactical narcotic, task force, back off fast
'Cause the crime boss is passin' off cash
Extortions for portions of streets causes beef
Havin' followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script, I'm not a actor but the author
Of a modern day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor
[Incomprehensible]
But you look so alarmed
As I walked on by
Babies crying, brothers dying and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block

One more chance to leave a mark
Imagining the answers in the dark
Such a simple step into the smoke and the light tonight
But who'd have thought I'd have turned this page?
Should I act this out or act my age?
Am I happy I came to the young man's game,
Where the bouncers know me by my name, tonight?
Oh I could I work this room
I could make some noise
Let's hear it for the girls and for the boys
For a moment be the same in the young man's game tonight
We're drinking Jaeger bombs but we're still on our feet
Heroes in a wild conceit
Fingering fame in the young man's game tonight
But every mirror just tells the time

Take off this paper crown

There are moments of joy that will go unmet
But really I should let
Let them all slide
But who am I fooling when I say I have no regrets
You can push things to the back of your mind
But you can never forget
I washed your hair in the darkness of the house
I saved a creature from the heat of the fire
And when you rose I saw your silhouette
But really I should let
Let that all slide
But who am I fooling when I say I have no regrets
You can push things to the back of your mind
But you can never forget
But who am I fooling when I say I wish we'd not met

Now that you got it all wrong
You got it all backwards, girl

When you can, seen you consorting with your invisible manhole
Fool child, you're never gonna make it

Just ask vanity, abandoned out in the rain by the world

Harmless little negress

In possession of eyes that say

A southern bunkhouse, blue skies up above
A kind of figure of feminine grace
And wit passes for love these days
All that slender-wristed, white translucent business
Passes for love these days
Passion, genius passes for love these days
Four more years, four more years
Four hundred more years of this shit, fuck it
I look up, I see the North Star, I look up, I see the North Star
When I look up at the bar through these tears
Four white pillars, Yankee style
All of America loves to lights his pipes
All of America live to light his pipe at night
To which Dixie responds, ""Free me""
And then lashes his sashes again
""Maybe or maybe not fast forward"", she said
""Maybe once the seed is sown fast forward"", she said
""This bird has flown south"", she said
""Don't talk about the South"", she said

Listen, I've been drinking
as our house lies in ruin.
I don't know what I'm doing
alone in the dark
at the park or at the pier,
watching ships disappear in the rain.
The world's just bones.
The world is black stones dressed up in the rain
with no place to go but home-
just like Nance.
On a night like this, why, she's pro-stars, pro-sky.
All lit up and sick of fighting
beneath the diseased lighting of the discotheque at night.
It don't mean a thing. It never means a thing.
It don't mean a thing. It never means a thing.

As apocalypses go, that's pretty good.
Sha-la-la, wouldn't you say?
Please remove your spurs.
Come to think of it, remove your antlers.
Haven't seen you for ages.
I still fly into rages at the mention of your name,
Christine White.
I think about you often, off in the desert,
laughing your head off in the Forest of the Night.
Say a prayer for the light.
So now I live well. I live in the mine.
I'm still slinging mud at the towers all the time.
I took a walk
and threw up in an English Garden.
I was born in the North, but my father's from the South.
Love is a political beast with jaws for a mouth. I don't care!
You're upset- and have every right to be.
Regretfully, you decline.
Every night was a waste of time.
Every night. Every night. Every night.
You were on the side of good.
I was inside of the sea's guts,
a crumbling beauty trapped in a river of ice.
A crumbling beauty trapped in Paradise,
oh yes, it was Paradise!
The tide comes in and the tide goes out again.
I suppose this is the kind of thing we see every day.
The tide comes in. The tide goes away.
Oh, the tide comes in. Yeah, the tide. Yes, the tide.
A ransom note written on the night sky above
reminds me what-in-particular about this wine I love.
Like a punctured beast, better-off dead,
compliments going to my head:
La-da-da, la-da-da!
And speaking of my mind (the Sunflower),
and speaking of a world turning sour on you,
I was twenty years old in 1992.
I was bathed in golden sunlight, alright?
I was ripped on dope. You were a ray of sunshine.
I was a hopeless romantic. You were swine.
You've got to spend money to make money.
You've got to stop calling me ""honey"".
Oh world! You fucking explosion that turns us around!
The searchlight slumps over, so sick of the night,
and the kids on the boats, busted in the shipyard
going down, down, down, down, down, down, down.
You traveled light (all night, every night),
to arrive at the conclusion
of the world's inutterable secret,
and you shut your mouth.
I've seen it all. I've seen it all. I've seen it all.
Free and easy. Gentle. Gentle.

See Him lying a cradle beneath Him
See Him smiling in the stall
See His mother praising His Father
See His tiny eyelids fall
See the shepherds kneeling before Him
See the kings on bended knee
Oh, See the mother praising the Father
See the Blessed infant sleep.
One small child in a land of a thousand
One small dream of a Savior tonight
One small hand reaching out to the starlight
One small Savior of life
Ooo ... Oh ... Oh ... Oh ...
One small child Oh ...

Organizing gameplans walk through life observing mayhem
I rock in all states yo my fans be up in safe hands, I take stands
With my team construct a plan plus move with my mind,
and try to find another land
On a search for my soul but sees my life is controlled
by propositions, aimed at my submission, to live in prison
These fake snakes and jakes be on a mission
They wanna kill sons and pull guns without permission
with no assistance, put you down at close distance
You need to have respect for existence, and listen
subliminal tactics with facts got you conditioned
brainwashed with ill intentions and bad religion

rivals face to face to lace the taste of wasting time in cycle
Cause i was told the bones of old injustices,
Have a way of rising from the tomb, plaguing nations with the silent doom
Letting violent tunes while at noon killing the wise from the womb
Consumed and lost in loot they prostitute our essence
So now it's here the message wasn't listened to,
Mandate Passed, Now a chosen few can't get in school
It was written true, but who's to think that Stick N Move was mental too?
Now who's the fool the revolutions all around you
Living through this trifeness i try to fight and keep it righteous
An try to show my people that we living through a crisis
Law is collapsing, and media's like pornographics
Exploiting the masses Prestigious corrupting classes
With doctored textbooks, and History that's backwards
Government raising taxes, Liquidating asses
Checks they skimming, Since evil money was infinite
It's time to rebel i been pushed beyond the limits
and out of time, the stress on my minds been inflicted
To live in this foul corrupt world i been convicted
These laws are wicked promoting nuclear projects
A million empty pockets and niggas is building rockets
Let's all get together y'all and stop it
Bring a revolution once the words of a prophet
And unlock it as my peoples evolved, the system seem to see-saw
Im thinking star wars and rebels, dark lords and devils
The charge was sparked before my birth the level's never even
The government was scheming now we easing for the get-back
Operation Double-Life Crew move past the set-backs
It'll take a better trap I see past the massed Illusion
The media's collusions with political abusing
The empires crumbling, now wars are fought in ruins
My point of view is screwed of it, my skin invites unruliness
With Rully games in three piece suits, to ruin movements
The wind of discontent is bent on ending this existence
The echoes of the past exacted real shit we live with
It's parasitic, breaking down barricades without limits
Some pawns are timid, falling prey to everyday living
and dying slow, the tide aint really high it's low
A violent foe lurks with lying folks that hide control
I part the seas and leave but still im sent the same shit
Cause my skin holds,
mellanin im jellin an form immediate plans of action
And my reaction?
It's time to rise,
Chorus
Building up my conscious mental enlightment, i be fighting with
the voice in the back of my head, making me write this shit
Deciphering my essence in questions it keeping me guessing
Of how to stay strong, learn my lessons and keep progressing
My intellect would beast on a set, y'all niggas hit the deck
and intercept
This plan laid down, you'd think that Hitler set
Yo it's a holocaust It's time to show force attack the source
Reinforce the way of life I'm willing to die for
You look in my eyes and see my fam that i cry for
Be careful planting seeds, i see these evil men breathe
So take heed to my words before you're locked up and stranded
I ain't asking for the revolution y'all
I demand it
It's time we rise
Chorus x2

360032,the-truth,2007,breaking-pangaea,Rock,"In a world of dreams, you can fly to the top
Waking up, it seems, would throw everything off
All your promises are a waste and my silence is a shame
But my sweet revenge is the truth
And everything that goes around is coming back to you
Everything, everything is coming back to you
If you don't even know you
You're saving it up for someone that you never met
Maybe this way goes against my way, too
But I want you to know that I saves room for you
All your promises are a waste and my silence is a shame
But my sweet revenge is the truth
And everything that goes around is coming back to you
Everything, everything is coming back to you
If nothing is real, then how could I hurt you?
If you cannot feel, what have I done?
If nothing is real, how could I hurt you?
It's coming back to you
All your promises are a waste and my silence is a shame
But my sweet revenge is the truth
And everything that goes around is coming back to you...
Is coming back to you....

Still without you now
Unaware
But without a doubt

And soon enough it gonna bring me down
But I want to be over you
I want to be over, over you
But it takes more and I willing to give you whatever it is
If we take this time now, we can kill this hope
But then again Ie gotta know
Can you picture possible anything at all
Can you picture anything with anyone but me

Do you still believe

faccio pi incubi da sveglio che di notte
Ho tolto i sogni dal cassetto e ci ho messo un'arma
cos se entrano i demoni in stanza gli sparo in faccia
Riparo non c' mai stato nel deserto che ho dentro,
il cuore un apparecchio difettoso e l'ho spento
nessuno indispensabile al momento,
nella mia vita non ho amici, ho sagome di riempimento
Ogni sentimento te lo senti dentro
vorrei essere sincero ma se menti, mento
Tanti io ho lasciato indietro senza pentimento
perch a stare con i lenti poi diventi lento
In mezz'ora la gente ispeziona,
cambia opinione su di me
ma io vi odiavo e non vi apprezzo ora, ancora no,
non mi fido e non mi fider
Questa gente chiede quando suono non mi chiede come sto
Ti domandi quando morirai
fossi in te non mi preoccuperei
L'erba cattiva non muore mai
nel giardino dei pensieri miei
Non ho pi radici che mi tengono
perch semino soltanto il male
Mentre i buoni mi calpestano
vorrei tutto finisse ma sono immortale
L'erba cattiva non muore mai, quanto vero
i cattivi in cima, i buoni al cimitero
Io ancora vivo e non so se sono buono o cattivo
ma sto in cima, e penso ""meglio l'umilt o la vita?""
Chi guida il destino prima o poi si schianta,
c' chi fa l'assassino e si ammazza se una stronza lo pianta
Dai piantala, chi ci crede al karma?
La fede non ci salva, per questo mi confesso con il barman
Ogni volta che bevo la vista si appanna ma vedo
i drammi che mi porto appresso riflessi nel vetro
non chiedo nessun aiuto a don Pietro, bestemmio, non prego
Schiavo non lo sar mai, l'unico momento in cui mi piego
per allacciarmi le Nike e ho capito ormai
che il buon senso come un sogno, vivo finch dormi,
quando apri gli occhi te lo scordi, capito il senso?
Ti domandi quando morirai
fossi in te non mi preoccuperei
L'erba cattiva non muore mai
nel giardino dei pensieri miei
Non ho pi radici che mi tengono
perch semino soltanto il male
Mentre i buoni mi calpestano
vorrei tutto finisse ma sono immortale
Mi hanno spezzato le ali per tenermi attaccato al suolo
ma quando spicco il volo mi dico grazie da solo
Tra disgrazie e successi non molti cambiamenti,
gli occhiali sono pi belli ma gli occhi sono gli stessi
e mi resta soltanto una penna e una melodia in testa,
finch il rimpianto si sveglia e mi meno via, merda
Vienimi a prendere, sono stanco di giocare a perdere,
fermate questa giostra, voglio scendere
Nel mondo in cui sto,
nel mondo in cui stai
Dentro gli occhi miei,
dentro gli occhi tuoi
Nel mondo in cui sto,
nel mondo in cui stai
Dentro gli occhin miei,
dentro gli occhi tuoi
Ti domandi quando morirai
fossi in te non mi preoccuperei
L'erba cattiva non muore mai
nel giardino dei pensieri miei
Non ho pi radici che mi tengono
perch semino soltanto il male
Mentre i buoni mi calpestano
vorrei tutto finisse ma sono immortale
Nel mondo in cui sto
nel mondo in cui stai
Dentro gli occhi miei
dentro gli occhi tuoi
Nel mondo in cui sto
nel mondo in cui stai
Dentro gli occhi miei

Dove la trovi la voglia di amare?
Guardare il paradiso da fuori
senza poterci entrare,parole d'amore,parole amare
le prime sono sempre piÃ¹ rare
e tu continui ad urlare
che non sono piÃ¹ piaciuto ai tuoi
dimenticandoti che tutto ciÃ² Ã¨ piaciuto a noi,
e ora la rabbia mi imbocca di cattiverie
mentre lanci i piatti
io prendo a calci le sedie

Nella testa c'ho le immagini
di quando stavi ancora qui
mentre cancello le tue immagini
dal mio pc
L'attrazione non Ã¨ sempre amore come dicono
due calamite uguali a volte si respingono
E a volte vincono gli errori
se servono a imparare
tu sei solo uno sbaglio da non rifare
tolgo la vibrazione al cellulare quando dormo
cosÃ¬ se mi chiami con te in un sogno
non me ne accorgo
Morto,dentro,innamorato di un ricordo
lottano ragione e sentimento
vorrei dimenticarti al mio risveglio
come ""Memento""
quando dico che ora penso solo a me mento.
Certo,tu mi pensi,io ti penso
ma se una storia non ha fine non ha senso
penso,che pure in questo inferno
con certe parole di ghiaccio
ti perdo come d'inverno.

E finchÃ¨ dura mi accontento
quando un cielo bello arriva al culmine
seguito dal maltempo
e cosÃ¬ Ã¨ stato,
Ã¨ stato un colpo di fulmine
ma adesso dai tuoi occhi
sta piovendo.
Una nuvola che non si sfoga,
resta nera,tutto passa in fretta
come una nuvola passeggera
e stasera,cuore in gola,
orti con le lenzuola
fredde come la stagnola
perchÃ¨ dormi sola.
Vola in alto con la testa
e stai con i piedi a terra
dopo la tempesta ci sarÃ  la calma
tutto fermo,baby, goditi il silenzio

Ti ricordi dell'anno scorso, lo stesso periodo dell'anno
Eravamo a Parigi fuori dal pronto soccorso, giovani e pazzi
La prassi? Fare sesso a piÃ¹ non posso
E poi litigare, vedere rosso fino a metterci le mani addosso
Adesso che siamo lontani, non sappiamo piÃ¹ nulla dell'altro
Come due estranei e mi fa strano, penso a quando dicevi ""Rimani
Che tanto il mondo ovunque io sia cambia il suo volto a seconda di come
Me lo rendono certe persone"", non sai quanto c'avevi ragione

Volevo solo dirti che la Costa Azzurra senza noi non Ã¨ un granchÃ©
Compare il mare ad ogni curva, ma ogni spiaggia sembra vuota senza te
Si stava meglio quell'inverno a passeggiare ai piedi della Tour Eiffel
E non vorrei morire a Saint Tropez o alle Seychelles
Ma sotto il cielo grigio di Parigi con te
[Strofa 2: Emis Killa]
La solitudine Ã¨ una brutta bestia, persi in una tempesta di sabbia
Con il cuore che ci dice ""resta"" e la testa che ci dice ""scappa""
In fondo che cambia andare Manhattan o in un qualsiasi posto distante
Traslocare coi propri problemi e vivere dentro una gabbia piÃ¹ grande
E adesso che c'Ã¨ solo gelo, troppe nubi per essere amici
Sempre piÃ¹ cupi, sempre piÃ¹ grigi, come il cielo quel giorno a Parigi
Tu hai preferito ascoltare gli amici, ti fidavi di ciÃ² che dicevano
E ora sei bella e col nulla attorno, come un'isola in mezzo all'oceano

Sai, non Ã¨ andata come credi te
Cambiare vita non Ã¨ stato semplice
Ma l'ho fatto ed ogni merito lo sento mio
Non Ã¨ il successo che mi ha scelto frÃ , l'ho scelto io
Se oggi mi guardo allo specchio e non so piÃ¹ chi sono
Ieri c'era un ragazzino, adesso vedo un uomo
Arricchito, ma Ã¨ da povero che io ragiono
PerchÃ© uno schiavo resta tale anche sopra ad un trono
Non ho voltato mai le spalle alla periferia
Anche perchÃ© non ho le palle per andare via
Palle sul mio conto e mani sui vetri dell'auto mia, l'apatia
Reagire come un automa, questo Ã¨ il prezzo dell'autonomia
La musica Ã¨ autobiografia e quindi mi rifiuto
Di fare un passo indietro, perchÃ© sono cresciuto
E se non lo capisci muto
Questo rap non ha futuro ed io c'ho pagare il mutuo

Non Ã¨ facile se sei un numero primo ed indivisibile
Dare un peso alle persone con due anime
Salutare e poi diventare invisibile
Mentre gridano il mio nome, non Ã¨ facile

Si dice ""Sai quello che lasci e non sai cosa trovi""
Quindi non molli i vecchi amici per i nuovi
Se l'amore Ã¨ meno forte dell'odio che covi
Quando finisce tutto guarda con chi ti ritrovi
Io continuo a pensare per i miei cari, ma
I miei colleghi no, solo gli affari frÃ 
C'Ã¨ chi fa di tutto per tenersi cari i fan
Zingari in vestiti cari che fanno al caritÃ 
Guardo dall'alto la cittÃ  come fosse un quadro
Ma perdo l'equilibrio se penso che forse cado
E quindi corro come un forsennato
Chi muore senza lasciare alcun segno Ã¨ come se non fosse nato
Ancorato al mio passato, Ã¨ tempo di partire
Giovane uomo fai ciao con la mano
Senza piÃ¹ niente da dire abbandono l'isola, ci siamo
E guardo il vecchio me morire mentre mi allontano

La mia storia Ã¨ un legame di amore e puttane
Di lame e collane, di soldi e di fame
Di lacrime, mi hanno detto ""Tutto diventa possibile""
PerÃ² il prezzo qual Ã¨? Non Ã¨ facile
Scriveranno la mia storia loro
Col rispetto sopra il foglio e con l'inchiostro d'oro
PerchÃ© alla fine ho avuto tutto frÃ , tutto da solo
E quando ho lasciato questa terra frate ho preso il volo
Questa cittÃ  sembra una giungla, perÃ² mi sostiene

E feci pugni come Rocky in piazza

Con la voce non con la webcam
E solo io so quante ne ho prese ma
Tutto questo era un cult
Non era un gioco comunicare
Prima che il Nokia fosse un supertrend
Andavo in centro per chiamare
Da una cabina come Superman
Per me Milano era come New York
Sui sedili arancioni di un tram

All'aquafan o al CocoricÃ²
Musica alta e cambi locale
Poche parole come Robocop
Il fisico delle impennate
Giovani folli come Peter Pan
Ci penso spesso e mi accorgo adesso che
Tutto questo era un cult
Certe pellicole da panico
Carlito e il finale drammatico
Di Caprio morto nell'Atlantico
Tony Montana col kalashnikov
Milioni spesi dentro un Pungiball

Rispetto ai macchinoni maxi ha sempre preferito il taxi
Non ce lo vedo De Niro che fa driver per Uber
I superman moderni stanno sul computer
Zero Kriptonite
Oggi Ã¨ la vita vera che li uccide
La concorrenza del rap non Ã¨ piÃ¹ mite
Ce n'Ã¨ sempre uno pronto a farti il culo
Come l'Uomo Tigre

Che per giocare ai videogame dovevo andare al bar
La solitudine accompagna anche le superstar
Finisce che parli con l'auto come supercar
Andavo da Blockbuster, i film di serie A
I Ghostbuster, Lo Squalo, Jurassic Park
Mi sentivo in paradiso in quel luna park
PerchÃ© oggi Ã¨ chiuso, tempo scaduto
Niente piÃ¹ cult
Andava sempre cosÃ¬

Con il pallone da mattina a sera
Tutte le strade sbagliate possibili ma
Purtroppo poche possibilitÃ

Tra povertÃ  e criminalitÃ 
Come fortuna quei piedi con cui
Corre lontano dai vicoli bui
Sa che non puÃ² commettere gli errori altrui
Loro non hanno il talento che ha lui
Sorridente anche se non ha molto
Ogni giorno rivive il suo sogno
Davanti a quel pallone sgonfio
Chiude gli occhi e palleggia col mondo
Sognando di scendere in campo
Mentre il dio del calciolo guarda dall'alto
Tira da scalzo pensando alla curva
Esulta emulando Ronaldo
Ripete a se stesso che ce la farÃ

PerchÃ© ho detto basta ai bastardi

Tu che guardi l'oroscopo in tele
Ma non credi nemmeno ai tuoi occhi

Che spingiamo l'amore in salita
Quando l'odio ci lascia per strada
Che non serve che andiamo in vacanza

Gridarsi ti odio, sorridendo un attimo dopo
Ma si Ã¨ spento il fuoco guardami dentro e cadi nel vuoto

Ma io sono troppo stanco per raggiungerti a nuoto

Per amore non sai se morire o uccidere
Dovremmo fare due parole perchÃ© le persone

Always this way
Onward with the same mistakes
Savor the pain

Let it be
Concealed in wraps
The odors appeal to me
To touch, rejoice

Sprawling from the caves
And from this land they call our father's

I heard it called a wilderness,
This desert is man-made
And the creatures mill around, bemused,
Asking who's to blame
If the powers that be
Truly believe in an eye for an eye
And if the punishment should fit the crime
Then the gallows await
Bread from Heaven
Powerless, we are powerless
The ants must climb this towering locust
Bringing it to it's knees
And we should crush this swollen insect
And regain our dignity
Yes, yes - flesh is carved with wraps and chain
and on his flesh the calves of waste"

And you give yourself away
What you did
What you said
That's the moment, now it's dead
Will never be the same,
Won't ever be the same,
The same again
At my door
I hear the bell
But can't look you in the eye
Sleep alone
The TV flashes on and on and on
I let you in
I see your face
But my patience fades away
I shut you out
When you wanted in
Now there's nothing left to say
You can take me down
But you can't take it back
You can take your time
But it won't bring you back here

Repeats the rites
To all that she needed
And wanted most

In the face of the light?
With you on my mind,

With quiet pride

Make it through the night

On calloused knees

The emptiness is all she sees
So she begs and she pleads

So, keep the pace and bear the weight you're given
And don't waste the blaze of the day

Don't waste your time, look at what you after
And I can see the stars that shine on me
It's the shape of hope
And I want you to go and I want you to stay awake
And I know that I'll find a way
Tat you can see what I mean
It's the shape of hope
So, look out
And everything I want to see
And everything you meant to me
And everything we hold is gone
Yesterday the breath you took from me
Was it out of shame? Or was it just a dream?
Well I find in me the destiny to be
It's the shape of hope
Just hold me now, just hold me down
Just hold me down and take away the beauty of
Just hold me down 'cause I can see the skin
I'm in is stretching and shaping and changing and changing
And I said it's over all over
I want you to go

When you don't respond to them TAXING
You fuck a lot when you're tax exempt

The more money you make, the more money you can have
You lose your mind after a while trying to just
Grab and grab and grab and grab and grab
Until the pimps roll around real mad, what they say?
""Pick up that money hoe!""
You done all the work, but now a part of the show
You're a hoe, you pimped all around real fresh
Got letters on they chest spelling I, are, S

Why? Because a wino don't want nuttin

I'm sorry that's the way it goes
In this particular system everyone's a slave
Racist is how they want us to behave

In a circle psychotically they slay each other

To a pimp, and it's you that limp

They don't care if you're in a bad mood

Genesis chapter eleven verse ten
Explains the genealogy of Shem
Chem was a black man in Africa
If you repeat this fact they can't laugh at ya
Genesis fourteen verse thirteen
Abraham steps on the scene
Being a descendant of Shem which is a fact
Means, Abraham too was black
Abraham born in the city of a black man
Called Nimrod, grandson of Kam
Kam had four sons, one was named Canaan
Here, let me do some explaining
Abraham was the father of Isaac
Isaac was the father of Jacob
Jacob had twelve sons for real
And these were the children of Israel
According to Genesis chapter ten
Egyptians descended from Ham
Six hundred years later my brother read up
Moses was born in Egypt
In this era black Egyptians weren't right
They enslaved black Israelites
Moses had to be of the black race
Because he spent forty years in Pharaoh's place
He passed as the Pharaoh's grandson
So he had to look just like him
Yes, my brothers and sisters take this here song
Yo, correct the wrong
The information we get today is just wack
But ask yourself, why is that?
The age of the ignorant rapper is done
Knowledge reigns supreme over nearly everyone
The stereotype must be lost
That love and peace and knowledge is soft
Do away with that and understand one fact
For love, peace must attack
And attack real strong, stronger than war
To conquer it and its law
Mental pictures, stereotypes and fake history
Reinforces mystery
And when mystery is reinforced
That only means that knowledge has been lost
When you know who you really are
Peace and knowledge shines like a star
I've only shown you a simple fact
It takes a nation of millions to hold us people back
Which is wack but we can correct that
Teach and learn what it is to be black
'Cause they're teachin' birds to be a cat
But ask yourself homeboy, why is that?"

Nor trapped by space and time

Constantly tell me how they are down
To uplift Africa and unite black
Yet they fronted when I dropped _Why Is That?_

Spins in heaven, while the earth I rock
MC's adopt, the styles I drop

So they want to go pop
Chasin the charts up and down like suckers
Totally ignoring their sisters and brothers

Here is a message to the super hoes
Just keep in mind when Jimmy grows
It grows and grows and grows, so let it
But keep in mind about the epidemic
When Jimmy releases, boy it pleases
But what do you do about all these diseases?
Jimmy is Jimmy, no matter what
So take care of Jimmy cos you know what's up
Cos now in winter AIDS attacks
So run out and get your Jimmy Hats
It costs so little for a pack of three
They're Jimmy Hats for the winter attack
Good for a present, great for lovers
Demonstrated by The Jungle Brothers
Protect your Jimmy and keep it fresh
They're Jimmy Hats by KRS
So, remember you're never too old (Jimmy is wearing a hat!)
Remember you're never too bold (Jimmy is wearing a hat!)
Do me a favour, wear your hat
So Jimmy will have the opportunity to come back
Well, Red Alert is down with BDP
Teaching you all about Jimbrowski
I don't wanna hear that you're not with it
Turn around and see your butt in a clinic
Having doctors just poke at Jimmy
Let me express what now what's in me
Too many people take too many risks
Too many people I see get dissed
Jimmy Hats are now in style
Cause you can't trust a big butt and a smile
Some are dry and some lubricated
Many companies make and made it
So all you super hoes, wear your hat
Cos dripping Jimmies is straight up wack
Keep in mind about Jimbrowski
Jimmy Hats by BDP
The J, the I, the M, the M
The Y, the J, the I, the M
It's Jimmy! It's Jimmy!

Act off your instinct
And think in a wink, or blink
I'll make your body shrink
I use ink and memory, my record companies selling me
My fans be telling me I'm the greatest
You hate this, rigid, metaphysical, criminal mided poet
Don't blow it, if it's lost, I'll show it
If it's torn, I'll sew it
It's kinda off beat yeah I know it
The styles I originate, I don't wait for fate
I practice love not hate
But mcs get ache
They wait and hesitate on the act
But always can debate on that trivial fact
This is krs and I'm black!
Same color as the brothers in iraq
War is wack, especially when you die in vain
Bush invaded panama, how can you really place blame on hussein?
Regardless of the name, the insane economic game has got to change
Like a range rover over the plains
I come equipped to rip shit
Not ignorant, intelligent - artistic - inquisitive - poisitive and negative
The sedative is the poetry I give
How yah live krs is in the house!
The poisonous product (is) pimped out to poor people
Penetrates pieces of their thinking equal
It comes in peaceful thru the ""tell-lie-vision""
Distorts your vision
Now the lies got you wishin' thru transmission
You wanna be a better christitan
You wake up sunday mornin' to watch ""tell-lie-vision""
Mission - christians be sayin ""accept jesus in your life""
Christianaty was founded 400 years after christ
What are you accepitng in your life?
Christianty or the teachings of christ?
Make up your mind, they're not the same thing
In 1992 the blind leads the blind
Right into the ground they can't show you where God is
Because they haven't found!
First - put down your Bible and release your sins
The Bible is dead, God is alive
Within, metaphysically speaking, I'll be clear
You wanna see god? take a look in the mirror!
A tree is always known by it's fruit
A human being can walk up right or crawl like a brute
Yeah, now who do you salute? the barbarian teaches us to hate our roots!
Despise our culutre, look for culture in another man's existance
Resist this - resist this master plan...
To turn the black man into a statistic
Why? 'cause he's materialistic
He wants to make a record but thru none of the logistics of it
Love it or leave it alone

Breath control a lone breath control A LONE
Breath control breath control breath control stylee

It's KRS-One, yes the t'cha

In your speaker, is the new style
Dedicated to the intelligent child
In the front row, or behind me
We're gonna pull somebody file for the 90's
You want lyrics? We come correct
BDP, only movin with respect
The other MC's, they can't believe me
A when I rhyme it sound just like a CD
We don't lip-sync, we go all live
On stage, I bring about four or five
That's D-Nice, Sydney, and Melodie
And myself, Harmony, and Willie D
We come humble, we just grumble
While other MC's crew just crumble
They want DANCERS, they want lighting
They want effects, to make them look exciting
But it's frightening, cause without that
The whole crew, is whick whick whick whack
BDP comes, with the cheapest
And perform miracles like Jesus
The total respect, we achieve it
And the big head-liner can't believe it
It's called breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, breath control A-LONE
Breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone.. get ready for the break..
Ha ha ha ha ha hah
Well the styles I, usually dish out
Are so dope that you don't want to miss out
We got PAGES, of the dope stuff
So in the record store, you can't pass by us
GET the album, HEAR THE MUSIC
And hold on so you just don't lose it
As a reference, for any MC
That want to test, K-are-S, O-N-E
Cause I've been watchin, these other rap groups
They walk around like they're some kinda big soup
You can't touch them, you only see them
In a arena or big coliseum
So when you watch them, for a second
Them sound NUTTIN like they do on record
Them sound cheesy, them sound wheezy
For twenty dollars boy you know them never please me
So I see this, and prevent this
It's like goin for a checkup at the dentist
'Cause when you come to a BDP performance
The microphone, had better have endurance
'Cause we'll check it, and then wreck it
And then the soundman has got to accept it
Because it's breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, breath control A-LONE
Breath control, breath control, breath control stylee
Breath control a-lone, take it out"

Now, here's what we do on the 48-track board
We look around for the best possible break
And once we find it, we just BREAK..
.. or, we just BREAK {âNERRRRRRRR-VOUS!}â
There's two ways to do this, you see what I'm sayin?
If you feel the board, you feel around
We got tracks one to track 48
We find track seven, and break it down!

I used to write KRS-One all over the place

A few hit records got me started real quick
I represent the Bronx, but I am a New Yorker
All vegeterian, never eat pork or
Chicken in a battle yes my brain starts clickin
Just like the gears of a watch, tock-tickin
I never lose time cause the rhyme is all digital
For suckers like you, I turn the power up to critical
On every playlist, waxin that anus
Suckers or professionals, BRING DOWN THE DECIMAL
Point every time you subtract an emcee
People look at me, a P-O-E-T
Teachin suckers like you about the I.C.U
And the KRS-One, sounds like arithmetic
Very psychological, why are you on the dick?
Well, my evaluation is sudden
Takin me out, is somethin closer to impossible
You could try your best

Always gettin brighter while the suckers will fade
Life is very serious, it's not an arcade
So everything you're hearing, KRS has made
MC's grab the microphone but don't know what to say
So DJ KRS has come to show dem the way
I always call you females by your name, not ""Hey!""
Cause ""Hey"" will only make a real woman turn away
Unless the woman is the freak of the year
Well then you know that KRS don't care
Unless the woman is the freak of the year, biddi-by-by
And then you know that KRS don't care
You always call a freak, by the garment they wear
Instead of call it clothes they always callin it gear
Big derriere to make the next man stare
Attracted to the man with jheri curls in him hair
Always puffin cheeba with a forty of beer
But to a re-al wo-man freaks-a can-not compare
Hold up ya han-ds if you a real wo-man
Hold up ya han-ds, if you do underst-and
The style that I'm sayin, without no delayin
Is Blastmaster KRS-One, just playin
It's really kinda easy for me, to do a style like this
It's kinda primitive, so please don't miss
The way I do this on the microphone, cause I was never shown
My mother wasn't into b-boyin at the Home
No one out can compete
And not another DJ rocks this type of beat
Come mi say
Come to the t'cha, come mi say come to the t'cha
Come mi say come to the t'cha come to the t'cha come to the t'cha
Come mi say come to the t'cha, come mi say come to the t'cha

Come in!
Verse 1
Many have claimed to attain levels in rhymin'
But when I listen to 'em I see they're only lyin'
They're tryin' but after some years if you ain't got it
Lay it down put it down find a way to try and stop it
Or change it, rearrange it, be a producer
Don't touch the microphone because you'll always be the loser
And laughed at, smirked on, you don't belong
With those that perform their song on and on
And on and on and on, yo, let's get specific
This style is for the gifted, poetically uplifted
I speak to you, not at you to attack you
Maybe when I'm through with this rhyme I'll get a statue
So now I ax you or tell you people literally
When it comes to rockin' funky lyrics few are better than me
Down with BDP, endlessly recitin' poetry
Any time I'm in the street, you hear my voice, you know it's me
KR...nope! I'm not ready to say my name yet
Many say they teach, but this style they haven't attained yet

Verse 2
Run it, son, plumb it you bum
Don't you know that it's KRS-One
That comes to sing the styles that ain't sung
I rocked the party, but oh! Gotta run
'cause only the suckers want a chance at that
To see if KRS-One is really all that
Instead of a rap I jap-slap all of 'em back
Because the teacher that you see is not wack
I'd like to stack up all the hits that I've made
Three albums, a triple-layer cake
And throw it in your face you waste
Pick up the pace and taste a poet from the black race
While I whip you whine, you're out of touch
I'm out of time, here's another rhyme
(The black man's in effect. Jeeeeeeesus! Oh gosh, dude. Oh gosh. Oh
yes, dude. Yes)
(What's the name of that crew? B.D.P)
(Say what? I'm not down with the Juice Crew)"
360199,how-not-to-get-jerked,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Now technically speakin' I ain't 'sposed to be doin' this
Like givin' information to the ones that are new to this
You want to make a record and get into the business?
Here's a little plan from a six year witness
First you gotta understand the music game
It's not about fame it's about a rich name
And who you're down with and who you clown with
But most of all, you got to have a gift (""it's like that"")
Either music or the fresh lyrics
Or a vibe; people like to buy your spirit
Everybody knows KRS-One is dope
To really see it, you gotta use a telescope, hah!
There's no hope when you're shoppin' for a deal
Either sex appeal, or the hard street feel
But if you don't have a lawyer you're a goner
Don't even think about chillin' in a sauna
You need a lawyer, and a good manager
Without this, the record companies won't be havin ya
So I'm grabbin' ya now and showin' ya how
Not to get jerked when you do hard work!
[Repeat x16]
""It's like that y'all""
""One, two, three, whoo!""
Yo, there's more to it, but let's get through it
Many MC's reached the top and then blew it
You say, ""I knew it, that last jam was wack""
Either you're strung out on crack, or you don't want to
Be black anymore, or, you don't want to rap anymore
Or, you do a wack tour, or, you get in trouble with the law
Or, your fans you ignore, or, you get punched in the jaw
'Cause, you're not hardcore!
What makes a jam isn't luck or fate
It's writin' the jams that the people can relate to
Or else they'll hate you
The public will mark you down as a fake crew
You don't need allathat
Just rap from the heart and you'll have a good start
But a lot of MC's want girls
And want to live on top of the world
In the jam they want to flirt
Here's how not to get jerked when you do hard work!
[Repeat x16]

The drink that I sip implies this it it
She looked to be about 26 I ain't dizzy
It's time to get busy!!
Welcome female is in my arms.
Overwhelmed by my playboy charms
We jumped in the ride rushed to the crib
I ain't gotta explain what we did
Built to last I simply waxed that
Ax the question, no need for guessin'
Hey baby, how old are you?
21 24 maybe 22
I'm twenty five

And said, ""hee, hee, hee I'm only 13""

She said, ""I want to be with you forever""
I said, ""Forget it I need to get my life in order
You could almost be my daughter""
She started sighin' and her sighin' turns into cryin'
Her cryin' turns into her replyin'
""Where's the phone?. I think it's time that I went home""
She called her pops and said, ""Come get me I'm all alone
I'm sorry daddy I slept with an older man""
He said, ""Don't worry. The 45 is in my hand.
I'll be there before you count to four.""
One two three four
He's at my door
She said, ""See what you did you caused me all this grief.
Your goin' to jail my daddy's a police chief.
If I can't have you no one will.
And I ain't even on the pill.""
But you was
Chorus: Repeat 6x
GOOD!!
Daddy walked in and the whole scene kinda changed
He grabbed his daughter and almost beat the girl insane
She's cryin' down the hall and now goin' home
He closed the door and, ""I'm happy we're all alone
Jump on the bed and look me straight into my eyes
I think your kinda cute, don't make me use my 45""
Daddy's lookin' for a lubricant
He pulled out a little piece of gum and started chemwin' it
He said, ""For year I've been lookin for a big strong man
I've got an apartment out in Brooklyn
Only my daughter and I live there
You can see my daughter anytime, anywhere
But it's you that I want to be mine
The price tag is your behind
Don't worry it'll be

GOOD!!
The morale of this story?
There is no morale you finish the story for me
When your livin' your life everyday in the hood
Wakin' up in the mornin' should feel

realize when they were writin this. The African is not a slave. The
African has a history far more advanced than this nineteen ninety

Question: Revolution implies killing..
Answer: Whether you fight or talk, the blood is
STILL SPILLING, and we're chilling
Thinking of our history as Elmer Fudd
Everything, black people got in this country
they got through shedding their blood, word!
But they ain't gonna print all that
They too concerned about what you wearin
what kind of Benz you got, or BM
But I think this year
since we knockin all these sucker frauds out,
you might get some press
But when you talk that consciousness -
nobody wants to listen
Word up, it's a crying shame though
I, ah-I tell you this though
if I was talkin sex and all that nonsense
I'd get ALL the covers
Yo Kris, just chill, and interview yourself
That's what I like to hear
Aight aight check it out
[KRS-One]
Everything you learned in law school
can be taught, when you're six years old
But they make you wait and wait and wait and wait
and wait, and of course, the information, is then sold
But what if you can't afford to pay?
You walk around ignorant all day!
The pimp don't care, it's really your decision
Kick up that money hoe!! Oh, I mean tuition
They be dissin, that ass you be kissin
Sittin in a room with a liar, and you must listen
Question: Who are you dissin?
Answer: The concept that turns a rapper, into a dancer
Question: Are you really all that fresh?
Answer: Yes, yes.. YES!
Or, ""si,"" to the people speakin Spanish
You better make use of KRS, before he vanish"
360203,necessary,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"When some get together and think of rap, they tend to think of violence
But when they are challenged on some rock groups, the result is always silence
Even before the Rock and Roll era, violence played a big part in music
It's all according to your meaning of violence and how or in which way you use it
Oh no, it's not violent to show in movies the destruction of the human body
But yes indeed it's very violent to protect yourself at a party
And, oh no, it's not violent when under the Christmas tree there's a look-alike gun
But, yes, of course it's violent to have an album like KRS-One
By all means necessary, it's time to end the hypocrisy
What I call violence, I can't do, but your kind of violence is stopping me
By all means necessary, the rap audience must grow up
The same type of fighting we do, they do, except we've got nothing to blow up
It doesn't matter if you win or lose, it's only how good you play the game
This is the oldest sneak attack, because it takes away our senses to gain
If all I do is play the game then I am just mediocre
We strive to be the best we can be, not to just get over
Some people say that life on a whole is serious and nothing is funny
But that's only if you base your life around competition and money
Yeah, I'm making some money, he's making some money, but none of these things are necessities
What I find to be a necessity is controlling a positive destiny
With this, money, fame, glory and credit will come in time
The people down with me know this, everyday they hear me saying rhymes
I got some friends, I got some allies like Stet and Big Daddy Kane
They know that by all means necessary that Peace is the name of this game
Whether peace by war, or peace by peace, the reality of peace is scary
But we must get there, one way or another, by all means necessary"

360205,illegal-business,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Cocaine business controls America
Ganja business controls America
KRS-One come to start some hysteria
Illegal business controls America
One afternoon around eleven o'clock
It was freezin cold, he was standing on the block
Sellin cheeba, nick's and dimes
Sayin a rhyme just to pass the time
The cops passed by, but he stayed calm
Cause the leather trench coat was keepin him warm
But this time they walked by real slowly
He thought to himself, ""They look like they know me""
They drove away, but he didn't stay
He jumped in the cab and he paid his tab
But guess who he saw when he hit the block
It was the same cop car, the same two cops
They jumped out quick, they pulled a gun
They said, ""Don't try to fight and don't try to run
Cooperate and we will be your friend
Non-cooperation will be your end""
He jumped in the car, and while they rode
They ran down the list of things he owed
They said, ""You owe us some money, you owe us some product
Cause you could be right in the river tied up""
He thought for a second and he said, ""What is this?
You want me to pay you to stay in business?""
They said, ""That's right, or you go to prison
Cause nobody out there is really gonna listen
To a hood,"" so he said, ""Good!
I'll pay you off for the whole neighborhood""
Because
Cocaine business controls America
Ganja business controls America
KRS-One come to start some hysteria
Illegal business controls America
A guy named Jack, is sellin crack
The community, doesn't want him back
He sells at work, he sells in schools
He's not stupid, the cops are the fools
Cause everyone else seems to go to jail
But when it comes to Jack, the cops just fail
They can't arrest him, they cannot stop him
Cause even in jail the bail unlocks him
So here is the deal, and here is the facts
If you ever wonder why they can't stop crack
The police department, is like a crew
It does whatever they want to do
In society you have illegal and legal
We need both, to make things equal
So legal is tobacco, illegal is speed
Legal is aspirin, illegal is weed
Crack is illegal, cause they cannot stop ya
But cocaine is legal if it's owned by a doctor
Everything you do in private is illegal
Everything's legal if the government can see you
Don't get me wrong, America is great place to live
But listen to the knowledge I give
Cocaine business controls America
Ganja business controls America
KRS-One come to start some hysteria
Illegal business controls America, KRS-One come to start some hysteria
Cocaine business controls America
Ganja business controls America
KRS-One come to start some hysteria
Illegal business controls America, KRS-One come to start some hysteria
Cocaine, sensai
Aspirin, coffee
Morphine, sugar
Tobacco, got to go"

When the suckers stepped up I had to use the drastic measures
I know you want to step to me kid!

Plus he rolls wit a crew that don't care
And drops a hit album, hit video, hit single every year
From your eye drops a tear
I don't play that shit, I play that hit
Your whole gangsta image is not legit
You heard ""Criminal Minded"", and bit the whole shit
Now if I punch you in your face I'd be wrong

Rap music, we want the rap music, bo!
Rap music, we want the rap music
Way back in the days, 1979
Fatback Band made a record usin' rhyme
In the same year come the Sugarhill Gang
With the pow pow boogie, and the big bang-bang
R&B;, Disco, Pop, Country, Jazz
All thought Hip-Hop, was just a little fad
But here comes Grandmaster Flash nonstop
And right after Flash, Run-D.M.C. dropped
Now, they had to pay attention to the scale
Where other music failed, hip-hop prevailed
See, rap music has gone platinum from the start
So, now, in eighty-nine we gettin' present as an art
Me ask, is it because we've got the eighty-nine vision?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Or is it because it's a unanimous decision?
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I put it upon the phonograph so everyone can hear it

Jealous of Ms. Melodie, me and Derek

360208,jack-of-spades,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Again we start let me say my part
About the only guy who has some heart
It took some time for the heart to come
But it's HERE and everybody's in fear
Crashin through the door of that WHORE
Bringin a end to this gold chain WAR
What you saw KRS One is now seeing
Another fly human being
Making, no excuses for the losers
Chain-snatchers, pimps, drug abusers
You don't like it but you gotta keep PUSHIN
Until somebody starts MUSHIN
All these suckers, claimin to rule the environment
(Nah man, I ain't buyin it)
You seem to think that everybody can be taught
That everyone else can be bought
But, you took a short, cause one guy hasn't been paid
He is the Jack of Spades!
He's a, calm kind of guy, courageous and loyal
But don't let the temper boil
Cause just like a pot when the whistle blows
(That's right boy, anything goes!)
The crime is committed and he's right on your tail
There's no bail, not thinkin bout jail
All the ends, are justified by the means
When Jack's on the scene
Track the movement, don't lose it
Cause if he come through the back, he ATTACKS
CRACK, cocaine, cops, and more fiends
Who all get the same in the heat of this gold chain GAME
Here is the aim
Destroy all the stereotypes, hypes, and crack pipes
We don't like, criminals, and crime
But we don't pay it any mind
So here comes Kung-Fu, Joe, and Fly Guy
Slade, Hammer, and Slammer
I, am a, renegade teacher and scholar
If you ain't up on it you GOTTA
Fall to the back of the line
Hear this rhyme, cause I'ma say it one more time
It's JACK'S theme song that KRS made
It's called the Jack of Spades!
You know, the Jack of Spades is now down with the BDP Posse
If you want to see more, just watch me
MAN, do what I do, throw your hands in the air
And scream it out, ohh yeah ""OHH YEAHHH!!""
One more time! ""OHH YEAHHH!!""
(Flash the rhyme!)
Cool, guy, loud and quiet
If your head's in the way, he'll FLY IT
Don't try it, cause Jack of Spades doesn't BUY IT
He's a one man riot
Cleanin the community, of all it's debris
The see-are-I-M-E
The road was long and scary and some didn't make it
The average guy couldn't take it
But JACK, is not, the average guy
He took a piece of the pie and BIT IT
Got with it, for his brother he DID IT
So you gotta admit it
This is a martyr, a soldier, a hero
WHY? Because he started from zero
In this battle he clearly understands their power
They're payin people by the hour
To sell, to lie, to try, to stand up and deny
They are gettin everybody HIGH
High on a cable, cash under the table
Currency is how they're able
To buy the cops and props and keep the law PAID
But here comes the Jack of Spades!
Break it down!"

I got a serious problem man
What's the problem?
Yo after all these years of rippin' shit
These suckers still try to front!
But check this out we've been on tour
with everybody so I don't know why they frontin '
Everybody!
y'all be in every party I be in every jam
I see they faces and they look at me and front
They come to every show and know we
break shit up all the time
You know what, yo Kris, what's your opinion?
Yo, I love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me
Rearrange me, tame me, try to game me, you don't play me
When I grab the mic then SHOCK the party spot
Your rhymes are flip-flop, I'll rock, hip-hop
Non-stop, me nah stop rock
You CAN touch this, but you'll get shot
Now what's this all about? Kris and humanity
In my face you're happy, on vinyl you're mad at me
Yo, pro-blackness is your solution
But I don't really know about that style you using yo
Too many Teachers in the class spoil the class
After awhile you got blabbering fucking fools
That's worse than always talking about sex, let's build
It ain't enough to study Clarence 13X
The white man ain't the devil I promise
You want to see the devil take a look at Clarence Thomas
Now you're saying, ""Who?"" like you a owl
Throw in the towel, the devil is Colin Powell
You talk about being African and being black
Colin Powell's black, but Libya he'll attack
Libya's in Africa, but a black man
will lead a black man, to fight against his homeland
An accomplice to the devil is a devil too
The devil is anti-human, who the hell are you?
I lecture and rap without rehearsal
I manifest as a black man but I'm universal
The capital K, small R-S
Capital P, small A-R, capital K, small E-R
We are, the star
Without the use of a car we go far
I build and destroy!
Yeah Kris, serve em man, serve em!
Yo why are they so jealous of BDP?
I don't know Will, yo don't get mad, get fresh man!
Word
Don't ever try to challenge BDP!
just shut the fuck up and listen!
This shit is crazy! Your remarks don't faze me!
People have a problem with me, cause I ain't lazy
I talk on vinyl then I act
What have you done, besides critique KRS-One?
I create organizations
Without organization, there'll be no black nation
What the fuck are you really saying?
You ain't a human while your music's boomin' anti-human
I'm assumin' if you ain't human you're a beast
The white man could be the devil all the day, that's the least
What are you doing for yourself black man?
Trying hard to be the original man, who?
The first man, with the first tan, on the first land
with the first clan, who gives a damn?
In history KRS is WELL advised
But it's something that my brain won't memorize
I don't base my whole life on memory
I base my life on my spirit and body chemistry
Africa is the home of humanity
Which makes the African a humanist, challenge me
You gotta learn not to be so concerned
with the original man, and see the criminal man, yeah!
The now man, with the now plan, with the now tan
with the right now genocide master plan
Damn! We gotta think about stopping this
God is not any black man on the land; God is consciousness
When you understand this you'll see Kris
Until then, you can get dissed
I'm not your prophet, messiah, minister, or savior
Chill with that ill behavior
I zero in like a laser
You're cuttin' your wrists with a razor
I got all type of flavors
Yes I am the original teacher
You gotta study the Qu'ran, Torah, Bahavaghita
The Bible, Five Baskets of Buddha Zen
And when you've read them shits, READ them shits again!
But watch what you're repeatin'
If you don't know the history of the author
you don't know what you're reading!
Yeah I'm still the original
Leaving MC's lyrically miserable
Their criminal syllables are minimal, show me respect BOY
Cause I build and destroy!
Now.. after all that
if anybody out there STILL got beef, check it out
We rip the lecture tours, we rip the beats
we rip the jams, we'll straight up rip that ass
know what I'm sayin' Will?
Word!
Yeah it seems they all forgot
On the mic you'll get fucked up
In the clubs you'll get fucked up
Anywhere Bronx Brooklyn Queens Manhattan
Jersey Japan Staten Isle.. yo anywhere you'll get fucked up
Don't you know we live for the battle?
I'm outta here
Yo cut that beat off"
360211,homeless,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Yeah...
You could call a man a bum with disgust on your morning run
'cause he lives outside in the street, you don't know this
But you've failed to realise that the one you so despise
Reflects yourself 'cause every black man is homeless
You could take your Alka-Seltzer while you talk about shelter
You might even want to talk about a little loan
'cause no matter how rich you become you'll always be two, not one
'cause believe it or not, America ain't your home
We've been taught to say our name, Afro-American, all the same
Not fully American but gettin' there very slowly
'cause to fully be American, you know, you gotta take out the word 'Afro'
Now they've relaxed I hear they might as well call us Toby
See, Afro and black are African, while theft is American
So how can Afro-American make much sense?
Your ancestors come from Africa
By stealing them now you're born in America
So the black man is homeless even though he pays rent
Some black people say 'We built this place
So we are American, but of the black race'
Well let me make this little topic known
The Japanese also built this place
In technology and they're winnin' the race
But at the end of the day the Japanese can go home
Do you see the point that I'm getting at?
I'm not a racist, I'm statin' a fact
Blacks are actually prisoners of war
'cause while South Africa continues to fight
We try our best to look more and more white
Proof that the blacks have been stripped of their core
Well, I guess I didn't sing and dance enough
For black radio to play this stuff
But this ain't soft like ice-cream with a sugar cone
I'm only here to state one fact
Wake up African, your colour is black
And every black man is homeless 'cause he ain't got no home."
360212,blackman-in-effect,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Wake up!
Take the pillow from your head and put a book in it.
It's time for the massive BDP crew at the top of the pile.
Yo. In the morning I'm yawning at noon is when I wake up
Make up my bed break up the bread and said
Scratching my head why am I so damn intimidating?
Is it because of laws designed to keep us waiting and waiting
Thus hating all forms of a setback
Get back if you can't understand a rap act.
This is the language of the people ready to hear the crew
I've got no juice, 'cause I'm not getting juiced
To have juice means you kiss and lick a lot of booty
To have respect means you simply new or newly
Heard what I had to say and felt as though you'd say that too
I'm not down with a juice-crew
But anyway I say today the message I create is great
I don't preach hate, I simply get the record straight
It's not the fault of the black race that we are misplaced
We're robbin' and killin', your own medicine you taste
You built up a race on the concept of violence
Now in '90 you want silence
Well, I want science, not silence but science
Scientific fact about black
The board of education acts as if it's only reality
Is talking 'bout a Tom, Dick and Harry
So now you learn your black history is questions and answers
Every question but the Black Panthers
Timbuctoo existed when the caveman existed
Why then isn't this listed
Is this because the blackman is the original man
Or does it mean humanity is African
I don't know, but these sciences are hidden
For some strange reason it's forbidden
To talk about, or converse on a political outburst
I don't believe that I'm the first
Or should I say the first one, or the first one that's done
Music like I'm still number one
Music like that or this is the incredible uplift
Those that oppose get dissed
But who will oppose the teacher when society's a wreck
So check the blackman's in effect
Near the Tigris and Euphrates Valleys in Asia
Lies the Garden of Eden
Where Adam became a father to humanity
Now don't get mad at me
But according to facts, this seems just fantasy
Because man, the most ancient man
Was found thousands of years before Adam began
And where he was found, again they can't laugh at ya
It's right, dead, smack in Africa
But due to religious and political power
We must be denied the facts every hour
We run to school, tryin' to get straight A's
Let's take a trip way back in the days
To the first civilization on Earth, the Egyptians
Giving birth to science, mathematics and music
Religion, the list goes on, you choose it
Egypt was the land of spiritual blessing
Egypt was the land of facts, not guessing
People from all over the world had come
To learn from Egypt, Egypt number one
So people that believe in Greek philosophy
Know your facts, Egypt was the monopoly
Greeks had learned from Egyptian masters
You might say ""Prove it"", well here's the answers
640 to 322 b.C. originates Greek philosophy
But in that era Greece was at war
With themselves and Persia, what's more
Any philosopher at that time was a criminal
He'd be killed very simple
This indicates that Greece had no respect
For science or intellect
So how the hell you created philosophy
When you kill philosophers constantly
The point is that we descend from kings
Science, art and beautiful things
African history is the worlds history
This is the missing link and mystery
Once we realise they all are African
White will sit down with black and laugh again
So judge not least ye might be judged
By the judgement ye judge, ye shall be judged
Matthew seven, first verse doesn't budge
No man should walk the Earth and sludgez
if you don't believe, you can go and check
To see how and where the blackman's in effect"
360213,love-s-gonna-get-cha,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Ya know that's why man I be telling you all the time man you know
LOVE
That word love is a very serious thing and if you don't watch out I
Tell ya
That (Love's gonna get you) because a lot of people out here say ""I
Love my
Car"" or ""I love my chain"" or or ""I'm I'm just in love with that girl
Over
There"" so far all the people out there that fall in love with material
Items
We gonna bump the beat a lil' something like this
I'm in junior high with a be	plus grade,
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade,
I walk from school to my moms apartment,
I got to tell the sucaks everyday ""don't start it"",
Cause where I'm at if your soft your lost,
To say on course means to roll with force,
A boy named Rob is chillin in a Benz,
In front of my building with the rest of his friends,
I give him a pound, oh I mean I shake his hand,
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man,
I go upstairs and hug my mother,
Kiss my sister, and punch my brother,
I sit down on my bed to watch some tv,
(machine gun fire) do my ears deceive me,
Nope, that's the fourth time this week,
Another fast brother shot dead in the street,
The very next day while I'm off to class,
My moms goes to work cold busting her ass,
My sisters cute but she got no gear,
I got three pairs of pants and with my brother I share,
See there in school see I'm made a fool,
With one and a half pair of pant you ain't cool,
But there's no dollars for nothing else,
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf,
Every day I see my mother struggling,
Now its time I've got to do something,
I look for work I get dissed like a jerk,
I do odd jobs and come home like a slob,
So here comes Rob he's cold and shivery,
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery,
I do it once, I do it twice,
Now there's steak with the beans and rice,
My mother's nervous but she knows the deal,
My sister's gear now has sex appeal,
My brothers my partner and we're getting paper,
Three months later we run our own caper,
My family's happy everything is new,
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do,
[Chorus]
That's why, (loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
You fall in love with your chain,
You fall in love with your car,
Loves gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind,
So I want you to check the story out as we go down the line,
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
Money's flowing, everything is fine,
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a nine,
Business is boomin' everything is cool,
I pull about a g a week fuck school,
A year goes by and I begin to grow,
Not in height but juice and cash flow,
I pick up my feet and begin to watch tv,
Cause now I got other people working for me,
I got a fifty five inch television you know,
And every once in awhile I hear just say no,
Or the other commercial I love,
Is when they say, this is your brain on drugs,
I pick up my remote control and just turn,
Cause with that bullshit I'm not concerned,
See me and my brother jump in the BM,
Driving around our territory again,
I stop at the light like a superstar,
And automatic weapons cold sprayed my car,
I hit the accelerator scared as fuck,
And drove one block to find my brother was hit,
He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring,
And all I could think about was war and,
Later I found that it was Rob and his crew,
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do,
Ya know that's why, (loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(love loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
(love loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
That word love is very very serious(loves gonna get you)
Very addictive
My brothers out of it, but I'm still in it,
On top of that I'm in it to win it,
I can't believe that Rob would diss me,
That faggot, that punk, he's soft a sissy,
I'm driving around now with three of my guys,
The war is on and I'm on the rise,
We rolled right up to his favorite hang out,
Said hello and then the bullets rang out,
Some fired back so we took cover,
And all I could think about was my brother,
Rob jumped up and began to run,
Busting shots hoping to hit someone,
So I just stopped, and let off three shots,
Two hit him and one hit a cop,
I threw the gun down and began to shout,
Come on I got him it's time to break out,
But as we ran there were the boys in blue,
Pointing their guns at my four man crew,
They shot down one, they shot down two,
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do,
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
(love loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
(love loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you),
(loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
(love loves gonna get you)
Ya know a lot of people believe that that word
Love is real soft, but when
You use it in your vocabulary like your addicted to it it sneaks right up
And takes you right out. out. Out. Out. Out.
So, for future reference remember it's alright to like or want a material
Item, but when you fall in love with it and you start scheming and carrying
On for it, just remember, it's gonna get'cha"

The only way to deal with racism if you're black
Well seven in the morning I woke up to jog
Rushed out the door to inhale the smog
As I ran I began to wonder
Should I produce or should I tour this summer
Well just that second I heard stay where you are
Before I could stop I was hit by a cop car
I laid on the pavement like I was hurt
Then a redneck cop jumped out with a smirk
He said, ah boy you better watch where you run
As he poked my side with the barrel of his shotgun
I said Officer man I ain't do nothin
He said what's that word you n----s use, ya frontin?
Well ya frontin, so why were you running down the street?
At this time I had stood to my feet and said Wait a minute
And that's when he did it, he hit me in the face with his gun I wasn't
With it so
On the ground was a bottle of Snapple, I broke the bottle in his
Fucking Adam's apple
As he fell his partner called for backup well, I had the shotgun and
Began to act up with that
Well I threw down the gun and began to run
I got back in no time and loaded the nine
First I took two clips and then I took two more
I was out the window cause by now they were right at my door
I took three shots and then I laid
They rushed in shooting so I threw a quick grenade
It went boom like a supernova
Badges arms heads legs cops were all over
I jumped out the fire escape down to the street and I started to run
You know I couldn't feel my feet, I was weak, I said to myself Holy shit!
My shirt had filled with blood I didn't know I got hit but there's no
Time to stop no time to explain man I'm in too deep with this everyday
Ghetto pain
Black men are judged by their clothes
Black women are looked at as hoes
So I as one of these uppity niggas
Can only rely on the sound of a trigga going
Well I staggered down the street to an old bookstore
Called the Tree of Life (Yo D it ain't there no more)
But when it was boy I was lucky
Cause in the basement is where they stuck me
When I awoke at the 14th hour
Three black women had gave me a quick shower
I stayed a while and escaped in a truck
Driven by two guys, Rakim and Chuck
What the fuck I asked as I laid there How many guys do you drive a day
There? Chuck said many, Rakim said plenty it's an everyday thing when
You're willing to sing a song
Well I threw down the gun and began to run
I got back in no time and loaded the nine
First I took two clips and then I took two more
I was out the window cause by now they were right at my door
I took three shots and then I laid
They rushed in shooting so I threw a quick grenade
It went boom like a supernova
Badges arms heads legs cops were all over
I jumped out the fire escape down to the street and I started to run

360215,exhibit-b,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"History can never be made by one man we must smash this one quickly
History is made only by the masses of the people this is clear
Even a cursory glance at the falasfallacious presentation
of history by the American capitalist system will demonstrate just this
Take George Washington as bad as he is
Put him in the middle of Valley Forge by himself surrounded by the British he can do nothing
Mhm hmm hmm
Take Martin Luther King as righteous as he is
Put him in the middle of Birmingham by himself, speaking out against racism
He would be lynched
But you take this same King, you take this same Washington
Put them in Valley Forge, put them in Alabama
Surround them with thousands of people who have the same ideas they do
Willing to make those ideas reality and the situation changes drastically"
360216,ya-slippin,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Now what you just heard, people, was a little kickin
But let me tell you this while the clock is still tickin
This is the warning, known as the caution:
Do not attempt to dis, cause you'll soften
Just like a pillow, or better yet a mattress
You can't match this style or attack this
While I'm telling you, write on schedule
Fuck with K-R-S and I'll bury you
Deep in the dirt, or sand with a shovel
No fight, no scurry, or scuffle, just muffle
Total domination on stage
Kris is the name, 22 is the age
Those that wanna battle, I know who you are
You got a little girl, you drive a little car
You come into the place with that look on your face
Before you ran the mile, you lost the race
So assume you're doomed when you step in the room
I'll be the witch and you'll be the broom
I'll ride you, guide you into the concrete
I'll slide you to a funky beat
So what do we have here?
A sucka in fear
I snatched your heart
Put it way up on the chart
At ten you're fucked
At nine you suck
At eight you're a sucker
At seven-a mothafucka
At six you're slapped
At five you're just wacked
At four you're lost
At three, you're just soft
At two you're an ass
At one, you're a dick
But before you slip, I'll whip
Cuz homeboy, ya slippin'
I understand that music calms the savage beast
But keep in mind that I compose my music piece by piece
First a bass, a snare
A little cut over there
I add my name K-R-S
And the shit becomes fresh
I ask Moe and ICU for their thoughts
Lay it down at Power Play all the suckas are taught
One again, the tactics of original arts
We're gettin' payed to the end cuz we were down from the start
We're known as Boogie Down Productions, ain't no B-boy stance
Guaranteed to make ya dance, if you give us a chance
We're goin' off and of course all ya suckas are lost
You wanna hear a fresh rhyme? You've come to the source
Because I'm the type of guy who's not put up on a pedestal
Run my rhyme on time and on schedule
One after another, another to the next
Can't rhyme when you're tense, or your muscles won't flex
Check your larynx
It may get lower havin' sex
Or may get higher
When bustin' as a liar
These are the things I teach so be taught
To me you're kinda short, how many battles have you fought?
If you come up with a number, notebook, or list
It just doesn't matter, you can still get dissed
I'm bringin' back that ol' New York rap
That gets you jacked while you're hands still clap
It's funny
Just dissin' you I can make money
But no one's tippin'
My message is simple: Ya' slippin!
E-N-O, S-R-K
When you go through other albums, you're sure to say
""Goddamn, they all seem to sound alike!""
Till you hear the crew standin' over in the light
Showing, glowing, on the top growing
The lyrics keep flowing and flowing and just flowing
Just like a river, or better yet a stream
I'm proud to be down with the winning team
So don't ever in your life even think about a arguement
Cuz you'll get walked on like carpet
We'll pick you up, and dust you off
Stamp BDP on your head and you're off
But you would even change that to say instead
""I'm down cuz I got a BDP on my head!""
So just before you inherit that ass kicking
I suggest you wake right up cuz ya slippin'"

They can not be disguised
But they will attempt to disguise themselves

But the words I wish to exert
Will hurt, damage or upset the ego
You want to be macho, yeah, but we know the deal

Pick the afro, need no Soul Glo
Or Carefree Curls, that's just a no-no

You got eyeliner on, chillin' and maxin'
See you're a man with a spine extraction

Four hundred years of cold weather, death,
And all that fryin' your hair shall not disguise you
As a matter of fact, she is so strong
That no matter what chemicals you put in your hair
She will come back and snatch it up
Tell me
Are you proud man, of who you are?
Or does your pride come out of a jar
'Cause if you bought it, put it on, or sprayed it on
I tell you right now, it won't stay long
'Cause if it ain't natural, it ain't kosher
It's like buyin' and wearin' a culture
If that culture ain't yours naturally
It's his, not yours, actually
You better wake up and smell the coffee
Look in the mirror and think Mr. Softie
People change, when they are ashamed
Of how they look or from which they came
Are you ashamed, of original black?
If you're not, why does your hair look like that?
Why is your nose straighter, from surgery?
I think you're really in a state of emergency
You're not sane to the African aim
So you're insane, and you need to obtain
Any, average rap album sculpture
And study it, just, to learn your culture
Even though, you don't think it's music
It's the blackest you'll ever get so use it

So I just walk, or ride my bike
If I walk to a jam well I'll rock the mic
Gimme a chance and I'll rock the house
But don't let a sucker try to take me out
'Cause male or female, I will strangle
If it's a crew, they'll have to untangle
Adidas, Nike's, arms, mics
Turntables suckers in the wheel of my bike
Step right up if that's what you like
But watch your head cause it'll fly like a kite
In the night at a height right for flight
Way out of sight, you bite, I recite
My style is bright, still you're sellin' out to white
As your faggot DJ would say, ""Well alright""
I am your mentor
Victory is mine, it's time you surrender
Sucker! And just back up quickly
Your style is sickly, but you persist to get me
Or outwit me with the style that I created
Years ago when you was doin' a dollar fifty show
Oh, all of a sudden you don't know
Or can't remember, can't recall, can't bring to mind
That rhyme that place do not chase
I run a marathon a race of rhymes in your face
In case you bass I'll erase your whole rap
Tell you right now I ain't tryin' to hear that
I don't dress up to rap or keep a hairdo
I only grab the mic and bust holes in a crew
I deny your existence as artists
You're puttin' out a record expectin' to chart
But it's weak, but when you speak through the microphone
You fail to realize nope you're not alone
On the earth, the light comes forth as KRS
Intelligence, force, and love manifest in the flesh
I snatch the mic and shed light
Behave, you're still a 20th century slave
Headed for the grave in a wave
So save the microscopic miniature small talk and walk
And put a little pep in your step
KRS-One will destroy any ignorant reputation
In the nation, in creation
Princes, Kings, Queens, or any occupation
Like rappers with nuttin' to say
I crush those idiots and throw em away
'Cause no matter how fatter the wallet, I'd rather
Gather together and splatter whatever
Egotistic mystics, with macho poses
If you ain't for black you're down for Guns 'n' Roses
Yeah! C'mon!
Throw your hands in the sky
And wave em from side to side
And if you're in this life just gettin by
Somebody say, alright! (Alright!) Alright! (Alright!)

Take it right now
Don't hesitate! (world peace)
You want world peace? (world peace) (peace take it)
Or world talk?
(World peace)
(World peace)
(World peace)
Yo, a lot of people are under the assumption
That peace, is soft or somethin'
We must begin to reprogram our thought
From, how we were taught
Back in school, and our tv screens
Strength, is always mean
Love, is always soft
And peace is too peaceful
When all are equal
Sit back, and read the papers
About the murderers, thieves, and rapists
We depend on police for justice
But when do we say, enough is enough
Right now, and call their bluff
It's not a matter of frontin' like you're tough
It's a matter of takin' yours
And livin' universal laws
'Cause those laws, cannot be bribed
Nor changed, or paid on the side
You must come correct and walk straight
More love, less and less hate
When you walk, walk with authority
Tell the negative people, don't bother me
Move your face away, I ain't with it
In a minute, I'm gonna hit it!
If we really want world peace
And we want it right now
We must make up our minds to take it
Right now!
If we really want world peace
World peace
And we want it right now
Or world talk
We must make up our minds to take it
Break it down!
Take it, yeah!
World peace
Yeah come in.
Crash, smash, don't ask
When the negative disrupts the class
How much longer? get stronger
The battle is getting longer
World, peace, or world talk
Do we run? or do we walk? (charge)
If you want world peace, take it
'Cause a lot of our leaders fake it (fraud)
It's similar to Armageddon
When the positive people stop lettin'
The negative, control, how we live
Listen to the music I give!
If we really want world peace
And we want it right now
We must make up our minds to take it
Take it!

and when they drop em, I don't kick em, check it
Like the Fat Boys said, I ""Brrrrrrrr, STICK EM!""
From that point on, I say we're on for the night
But I love it when the girl just call me D-Nice
And if she gets bold and try to ask for a fee
I say, ""Please hoe, it's all about me""
[Heather B]
It's not the star spangled banner or the red white and blue
but the underground sister from the Edutainment crew
So what you do, is back up if you work for Bush
Cause all the Presidential prison pushin politicians
gotta get MUSHED, gimme back my land you SUCKA
You beat down my father and you raped my mother Africa
And now you want to laugh at her
I feel like pickin up a razor, and slashin ya
Snatch up Margaret Thatcher and unmaskin her
to find out she's a man without a manicure
Go to President DeKlerk without askin her
and BUST SOME SHOTS for South Africa
And if Margaret jumps in, I start bashin her
for every freedom fighter start crashin her
And then Heather be	will get nastier
and pull out my two shot derringer
Cause yes, Heather be	comes classier
Cause Heather be	, Jamal-Ski, and KRS the trainer

Why are metaphysical teachings forbidden?
Why are metaphysical teachings forbidden?
The only way to talk to God is in church?
Hah hah hah you must be kidding!
For years they kept God hidden
Look for God in self not in what's written
Turn this up and listen
If your slavemaster wasn't a Christian you wouldn't be a Christian
If your slavemaster wasn't a Christian you wouldn't be a Christian
If your slavemaster wasn't a Christian you wouldn't be a Christian!!!
Your whole culture's missing
Hebrews are African, see they originated Judaism
The belief in one God is monotheism, see the truth is not hard
All you gotta know is the facts
When religion mixes with politics, it all gets wack!
You gotta know your history, or they'll tell you that God is a mystery
And when you're born, you're born in sin
That's bullshit.
That's bullshit!
They're only saying you can't win
You can't succeed, you can't achieve
Don't ask about God, just sit there and believe
Well I ain't tryin to hear that lesson
'Cause one thing I know
'Cause one thing I know
'Cause one thing I know is that the truth can always be questioned
Yeah that's how I'm livin'
Ask and ye shall be given
When you're lyin', hah hah hah, you got no answers
You got hand clappers and a whole lotta dancers
in the church or sanctuary
They all forgot Jesus was a revolutionary
They all forgot Jesus was a revolutionary
They all forgot Jesus was a revolutionary!!!
That hung out with criminals
I would say read the Bible but it's not the original
So it's really misleading
If you don't know the history of the author you don't know what you're reading
If you don't know the history of the author you don't know what you've read
You can't taste the nectar
That answers the question on why I do lectures
'Cause where every MC claims to be the teacher, I be dissin'! Professors
Keep that Bible on your shelf
God helps those that help themselves
Stop reading from a dead book
Stop reading from a dead book for a live God!
You know how stupid you look!
God reads the Bible with you
You both read the language of the devil that's dissing you
What can the next man do
With a Bible in his hand that you yourself can't do?
Whether Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, or Jew
Burning candles don't get you down with the universal crew
So why you dress up on Easter and worship a false Mary
That looks like Mona Lisa? Hah hah, damn you lost
On Christ-mas, what's the purpose of Santa Claus?
On Christ-mas, what's the purpose of Santa Claus?
On Christmas what's the purpose of Santa Claus!!!
Or Saint Nickalaus, I'm sick of this wickedness
All revolutionaries check this
I'm not synthetic
I'm not anti-Christian, anti-Muslim, anti-Buddhist, or anti-semetic
But I will set it off in the temple

Give it to em!
Nuff respect! And praise to the creator
Over the years it seems that I became a
landmark in the hip hop field of art
I shed light yet my skin is dark
I'm not conerned with climbin the chart
Cause why should you pay when it comes from the heart?
I'll start cause only Jah will create it
I'll just name it Edutainment
People sit and they look at my album
like a problem, they try to solve em
They don't know, it only leads the way
to a bright more positive day
By itself, it's NOT the bright day
Sit up straight, and hear what I say
Fear and ignorance, I'm down for stoppin this
but the bright day is your consciousness
I am poet, my words will heal you
I'm not a phony I'll really feel you
That's why I walk and talk to my nation
Wherever they are, in any situation
They usually ask for an autograph
And I'll whip out the pen and just write Blast-
-Master, K-are-S, O-N-E
BDP, Peace and Unity
But do not concentrate on the paper
Concentrate on the laws of the creator
Cause when the paper's gone, it will deceive you
But Allah will never leave you
Nothing I say now is hypothetical
These are the facts, a little metaphysical
We are one, every heart every lung
So why then was the black man hung?
He was hung by the so-called Christians
that went to church, and did not listen
See Jesus couldn't stand politics
so they nailed him to a crucifix
Then it was that way, today it's a trigger
So why is the Pope such a political figure?
I don't know, but it's really beyond me
But through knowledge, they'll NEVER con me
Cause from Jesus Christ to right now
everytime a black man speaks up, KA-POW
See people concentrate on the leader
And not the message comin through the speaker
If the Christians really heard Christ
the black man never would've lived this life
My point is that do not concentrate
on what I state, create, or debate
I might be great, and you might admire
But what I say is to take you MUCH higher
MORE higher than the physical plane
to the plane of forces in the astral plane
The mental plane, and the final three
They're all around you, yet you can't see
So grab the sphere of life and aim it
and you'll be guided by Edutainment"

Makin' funky music is a must
I'm number one.
People still takin' rappin' for a joke
A passing hope or a phase with a rope
Sometimes I choke and try to believe
When I get challenged by a million MCs
I try to tell them, ""We're all in this together!""
My album was raw because no-one would ever
Think like I think and do what I do
I stole the show, and then I leave without a clue
What do you think makes up a KRS?
Concisive teaching, or very clear speaking?
Ridiculous bass, aggravating treble
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid
Not by financial aid, but a raid of hits
Causing me to take long trips
I'm the original teacher of this type of style
Rockin' off-beat with a smile
Or smirk or chuckle, yes some are not up to
BDP Posse so I love to
Step in the jam and slam
I'm not Superman, because anybody can
Or should be able to rock off turntables
Grab the mic, plug it in and begin
But here's where the problem starts, no heart
Because of that a lot of groups fell apart
Rap is still an art, and no-one's from the Old School
'cause Rap is still a brand-new tool
I say no-one's from the Old School 'cause Rap on a whole
Isn't even twenty years old
Fifty years down the line, you can start this
'cause we'll be the Old School artists
And even in that time, I'll say a rhyme
A brand-new style, ruthless and wild
Runnin' around spendin' money, havin' fun
'cause even then, I'm still number one.
[Verse 2]
Blastmaster KRS-One of course
Comes to express with style the lost
Ways of rhyming, old and new, past and present
Knock, knock, who is it?
A brand-new style, hup, time to change
People talk about me when they see me on stage
Live in action, guaranteed raw
I hang with the rich and I work for the poor
Now tomorrow you can say you saw
KRS-One stompin' once more
I play by ear, I love to steer
The Alfa Romeo from here to there
I grab the beer, but not in the ride
'cause I'm not stupid, I don't drink and drive
I'm not a beginner, amateur or local
My album is sellin' because of my vocals
You know what you need to learn?
Old School artists don't always burn
You're just another rapper who's had his turn
Now it's my turn, and I am concerned
About idiots posing as kings
What are we here to rule?
I thought we were supposed to sing
And if we oughta sing, then let us begin to teach
Many of you are educated, open your mouth and speak
KRS-One is something like a total renegade
Except I don't steal, I rhyme to get paid
Airplanes flyin', overseas people dyin'
Politicians lyin', I'm tryin'
Not to escape, but hit the problem head-on
By bringin' out the truth in a song
So BDP, short for Boogie Down Productions
Made a little noise 'cause the crew was sayin' somethin'
People have the nerve to take me for a gangster
An ignorant one, something closer to a prankster
Doin' petty crimes, goin' straight to penitentiary
But in a scale of crime that's really elementary
This beat is now compelling me to explain in silence
Why my last jam was so violent
It's simple: BDP will teach reality
No beatin' around the bush, straight up, just like The P Is Free
So now you know, a poet's job is never done
But I'm never overworked, 'cause I'm still number one."

Down with the sound called BDP
If you want to join the crew, well, you must see me
Ya can't sound like Shan or the one Marley
Because Shan and Marley Marl dem-a-rhymin like they gay
Pickin up the mic, mon, dem don't know what to say
Saying that hip-hop started out in Queensbridge
Saying lies like that, mon, you know dem can't live

Bronx keeps creating it, and Queens keeps on faking it

Here's an example of KRS-One, bo!
Here's an example of KRS-One
They wish to battle BDP, but they cannot
They must be on the dick of who? DJ Scott La Rock
Cause we don't complain nor do we play the game of favors
Boogie Down Productions comes in three different flavors
Pick any dick for the flavor that you savor
Mr. Magic might wish to come and try to save ya
But instead of helping ya out he wants the same thing I gave ya
I finally figured it out, Magic mouth is used for sucking
Roxanne Shante is only good for steady fucking
MC Shan and Marley Marl is really only bluffing
Like Doug E. Fresh said ""I tell you now, you ain't nothing""
Compared to Red Alert on KISS and Boogie Down Productions
So easy now man, I me say easy now mon
To KRS-One you know dem can't understand
Me moving over there and then me moving over here
This name of this routine is called ""Live At Union Square""
Square, square, square, ooooooooooooooooooooooo
What's the matter with your MC, Marley Marl?
Don't know you know that he's out of touch
What's the matter with your DJ, MC Shan?
On the wheels of steel Marlon sucks
You'd better change what comes out your speaker
You're better off talking bout your wack Puma sneaker
Cause Bronx created hip-hop, Queens will only get dropped
You're still telling lies to me
Everybody's talking bout the Juice Crew

So BDP will teach them, hey, we will teach them
BDP will teach them, hey, we will teach them

And in a hurry, just in the nick of time
Cause I do four things: rhyme, produce, teach, and bring to you new styles
Well here's the first style, right out the pile
It's called vocabulary, difficult, isn't it?
At least is looks that way when you witness it
Kill (kill?) meaning to deprive of life
Fiancee: future wife
Poet (poet): a person who writes poems
Wandering, meaning to roam
Everyone sees me when I walk into the public
Even the suckers, I just love it
When they get disgusted every time I prove
(Boogie Down Pro) Boogie Down Productions will move
Meaning to motivate, lest rhyme straight
Hate is a very very big mistake
It rhymes with frustrate and aggravate
Let me just demonstrate why I won't abbreviate
Television, a view of scenes transmitted
Every single second you get it
Pepsi (what?) the choice of a new generation
Fired from work: termination
Quality: something special about an object or person
Can you rock a party without rehearsing?
I can, anytime, on the spot rhyme
Many recording artists can't do it, but I'm
More than just a recording artist kicking dust (who?)
I'm a sandstorm, taking human form
K plus R S equals one
I don't burn anymore, I just cook 'till you're done
And when you're done, then I serve
Like alphabet soup, (letters) letters, (words) words
Sentences, chunks of meat into a paragraph
Get the meaning then ask the question 'bout the guy
Who first is down but then he lies
What he is to you, he's a part time sucker
Kewe-kewe-K, Arewa-arewa-R, Ewe-ewe-S, my rhymes are fresh
Please step back, let me progress
Meaning to advance, you only get a glance
Of me at a time, sayin' some rhyme
Or sayin' some rekkid, that should respect it, select it
I'm never ever wack or reject it
Challenge BDP it get's dissed, expect it
I travel the nation by mostly plane
I travel New York by either cab or the train
Some say that I'm insane, they say
Why would you want to ride the train
(But I) but I don't care, as long as I get there
I never used to pay my fare, but now I think I got to
Because from a jail cell I can't rock you
That's being incarcerated, meaning locked up
(A tool) a tool for holding water is a cup or pail
The opposite for fresh is stale
(The largest) the largest sea-mammal is a whale
Beer is called ale, or sometimes it is called brew
(A group a) a group of human beings is a crew
You know what I'm gonna do? Explain Criminal Minded
Cause much too many people still are blinded
Let me rewind it, and elaborate on blinded, meaning can't see through me
He he he he he, these people make me laugh
The way they like to change up the past
So when you're there in class, learning `his story'
Learn a little of your story, the real story
It doesn't pay to know the life and times of someone else
It doesn't benefit your wealth or your mental health
I go for self, but the real self is one with all
This self who's by himself does fall
Down, just like the guy who first was down, but then he lies
What he is to you, he's a part time sucker
Alright, now here we go"
360228,my-philosophy,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Let us begin, what, where, why or when
Will all be explained like instructions to a game
See I'm not insane, in fact I'm kind of rational
When I be asking you, ""Who is more dramatical?""
This one or that one, the white one or the black one
Pick the punk, and I'll jump up to attack one
KRS-One is just the guy to lead a crew
Right up to your face and diss you
Everyone saw me on the last album cover
Holding a pistol something far from a lover
Beside my brother, S-C-O-T-T
I just laughed, cause no one can defeat me
This is lecture number two, ""My Philosophy""
Number one, was ""Poetry"" you know it's me
This is ""My Philosophy,"" many artists got to learn
I'm not flammable, I don't burn
So please stop burning, and learn to earn respect
Cause that's just what KR collects
See, what do you expect when you rhyme like a soft punk
You walk down the street and get jumped
You got to have style, and learn to be original
And everybody's gonna wanna diss you
Like me, we stood up for the South Bronx
And every sucker MC had a response
You think we care? I know that they are on the tip
My posse from the Bronx is thick
In real real life, we roll correctly
A lot of suckers would like to forget me
But they can't, cause like a champ I have got a record
Of knocking out the frauds in a second
On the mic, I believe that you should get loose
I haven't come to tell you I got juice
I just produce, create, innovate on a higher level
I'll be back, but for now just seckle!
I'll play the nine and you play the target
You all know my name so I guess I'll just start it
Or should I say start this, teaching I'm the artist
Styles and new concepts at their hardest
Yo, cos I'm a teacher and Scott is a scholar
It ain't about money cause we all make dollars
That's why I walk with my head up
When I hear wack rhymes I get fed up
Rap is like a set-up, a lot of games
A lot of suckers with colorful names
I'm so-and-so, I'm this, I'm that
Huh, but they all just wick-wick-wack
I'm not white or red or black, I'm brown
From the Boogie Down
Productions, of course our music be thumping
Others say they're bad, but they're bugging
Let me tell you something now about Hip Hop
About D-Nice, Melodie, and Scott La Rock
I'll get a pen, a pencil, a marker
Mainly what I write is for the average New Yorker
Some MC's be talking and talking
Trying to show how black people are walking
But I don't walk this way to portray
Or reinforce stereotypes of today
Like all my brothers eat chicken and watermelon
Talk broken english and drug selling
See I'm telling, and teaching pure facts
The way some act in rap is kind of wack
And it lacks creativity and intelligence
But they don't care cause their company's selling it
It's my philosophy, on the industry
Don't bother dissing me, or even wishing we'd
Soften, dilute, or commercialize all the lyrics
Cause it's about time one of y'all hear it
And hear it first-hand from an intelligent brown man
A vegetarian, no goat or ham
Or chicken or turkey or hamburger
Cause to me that's suicide, self-murder
Let us get back to what we call Hip Hop
And what it meant to DJ Scott La Rock
How many MC's must get dissed
Before somebody says, ""Don't f*** with Kris!""
This is just one style, out of many
Like a piggy bank, this is one penny
My brother's name is Kenny - that's Kenny Parker
My other brother I.C.U. is much darker
Boogie Down Productions is made up of teachers
The lecture is conducted from the mic into the speaker
Who gets weaker? The king or the teacher
It's not about a salary it's all about reality
Teachers teach and do the world good
Kings just rule and most are never understood
If you were to rule or govern a certain industry
All inside this room right now would be in misery
No one would get along nor sing a song
Cause everyone'd be singing for the king, am I wrong?!
I say yo, what's up, it's me again
Scott La Rock, KRS, BDP again
Many people had the nerve to think we would end the trend
With Criminal Minded, an album which is only ten
Funky, funky, funky, funky, funky hit records
No more than four minutes and some seconds
The competition checks and checks and keeps checking
They take the album, take it home, and start sweating
Why? Well it's simple, to them it's kind of vital
To take KRS-One's title
To them I'm like an idol, some type of entity
In everybody's rhyme they wanna mention me
Or rather mention us, me or Scott La Rock
But they can get bust get robbed, get dropped
I don't play around nor do I F around
And you can tell by the bodies that are left around
When some clown jumps up to get beat down
Broken down to his very last compound
See how it sounds? a little unrational
A lot of emcees like to use the word dramatical!
Fresh for '88, you suckers"
360229,like-a-throttle,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Ha ha hah hah! Da doo doo doo do doo
You want to test me are you stupid?
Gotta be out of your FUCKIN mind
KRS One is the DON seen?
Come down Kenny Park ah!!
Hahaha you know
I don't know what your management be tellin you
I don't know what your producers be tellin you
But yo you step this way
You're gettin PLAYED out of position
So let me give you a little style
Check it out
Everytime KRS-One steps in the jam
The party is packed, he got the mic in his hand
Brooklyn's ready Uptown's in the house
Kenny drops the beat and we turn the party out
That's it! None of the gimmicks, tricks, oh it's
You either have the hits, or the crazy hype lyrics
But MC's come half-assed, and lookin pitiful
None of em lyrical but their ego is critical
Like I said I'm not a Muslim but to Allah I'm obedient
Some MC's on the mic become Muslims when it's convenient
And I've seen it!
Real Muslims praise Allah, and they mean it
Others are dreamin it with Sex Me and Do Me and
I'd rather listen to the Brand Nubians
You know it's funny everybody wants money
And material things from cars and chicken wings
When they sing, they sing for the cash
They fail to realize, respect will outlast cash
You get respect by bein creative
And yes a native to your audience, so you know reality
In other words, if you ain't a gangsta why play you a gangsta?
If you ain't a hoe, why sell sex?
If you believe in Allah, how is it you can only work when there's a
Check?
All of this is incorrect
First should always come respect
The charts are not equal to the respect of the people
Their respect doesn't weeble or wobble
They know the difference from an artist and a lip-syncin model
Right on stage, you'll get a bottle
You're-holding-my-dick-like-a-throttle
I'm the freshest thing on the mic don't mess with me
I'm fresher than your grandmother's fried chicken recipe
Don't test me, you ain't a chemist and I sure ain't chemistry
You're not a mathematician and my name ain't geometry
You're no astronomer why see me as astronomy
But I'm a Parker so I'll play you like Monopoly
Don't entertain the thought of droppin me
To think of me as anything less than your teacher
Crazy you got to be
These type of lyrical styles cannot be said sloppily
I rip it up constantly
You're-holding-my-dick-like-a-throttle
The teacher will come, again and again and again and again
To set the trend and lend to other men a perfect blend
So-when-their-lyrics-finish-KRS-One-just-begin
RIPPING up sucker teachers put their courage to an end
So once again, the trendsetter comes a lot better
Forever too clever for a petty MC in leather
Whenever they decide, whatever I'm in sync
The lyrics I write, help me think
To guide ink off the paper through the air smack in your face
And erase in haste the rhymes you embrace
Just in case, get the FUCK out my face I run this place
You're lucky you're from the same race
A simple technique will keep you on beat
With the style from the street you compete with the elite
That's WEAK -- flashin gold and can't speak
I seek the direction of the brown complexion
So every year, I appear somewhere
That you hear my dear to get one thing clear
Whether on welfare or millionaire
Don't step to this here or you outta here
Allow me now to please change the gear
And-pick-up-the-mic-you-missed-those-happen-around-me-have-me-feared,
Come!?
We come in the dance we haffa likka of a shot an towah?
Let's get back to the hip-hop
You come into the place you can't LOOK in my face
'Cause the light is bright and I'm towering in height
See there are millions of stars in the sky
When the sun appears none are visible to the eye
Why, the reason is the sun is the sun
You can't possibly rock, until I'm done
And finished, and like the evening I'll fade
But when I return you'll cry for more shade
So check the dancestyle cause I am not
Softening up it's time that I rock and sing
Not about my ding-a-ling-a-ling!
But instead bring intellect pon ting
'Cause you can inject ignorance in rap
But Kenny Parker ain't tryin to hear that"
360230,the-racist,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"I've been taught to respect my elders and behave
Even if when they were young they sold slaves
Truth and understandin' is what I crave
In the land of the thief home of the slave
Turn your page to a brief demonstration
'Cause now in '90 it's strictly information I'm givin'
Teachin' on a regular basis
Today's lecture is about The Racist
We're not out to exaggerate or diss him
But show the symptoms and facts of racism
Understand The Racist ain't equal
There's about five different types of racist people
First of the five different types of cases
Is the individual brought up racist
Here you have young men and women
Brought up in the Great White Way opinion
This opinion introduced by the parent
To the civilized becomes transparent
The civilized man could look through the faces
Make the analysis and see The Racist
Number two case which y'all must hear
Is the individual racist out of fear
Here you have people that fear the African
And conjure up new ways of trappin' him
Number three is the unconscious racist
Not knowin' they're racist they invade your spaces
They say, ""I'm not a racist, I'm not a bigot""
Yet they allow it to go on and won't admit it
Number four is the money racist
The one that used the topics of sheer economics
They say, ""Owning a business isn't for the black man
He don't want that"", yet they went and took his land
Damn, that's like a rock in a hard place
You don't have your land yet this ain't your space
America was built by every other race
Except the European that runs this place
What a waste, America's doomed
To be overthrown by the righteous real soon
But last but not least racial prejudice
Is the black man speakin' out of ignorance
Whitey this and Ching-Chow that
Is not how the intelligent man acts
You can't blame the whole white race
For slavery, 'cause this ain't the case
A large sum of white people died with black
Tryin' hard to fight racial attacks
The media wants you to think that no whites
Really fought and died for Civil Rights
But once we have a true sense of history
You'll see this too as a mystery
If black and white didn't argue the most
They could clearly see the government's screwin' 'em both."
360231,drug-dealer,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"All over the world...
Chorus:
Black drug dealer you have to wise up
And organize your business so that we can rise up
If your gonna sell crack then don't be a fool
Organize your money and open up a school
Verse One:
Drug dealer understand historical fact
Every race got ahead from sellin drugs except Black
We are under attack here comes another cold fact
In the 30's and 40's a drug dealer wasn't black
They were Jewish, Italian, Irish, Polish, etc. etc.
Now in 90 their live's a lot better
They'll sell you a sweater, a pair of pants cold hearted
But first sellin drugs and killin people is how they started
Drug dealer, black and Hispanic, stop killin one another
Cause in the ghetto we're all brothers
Organized economically, understand the psychology
America is the drug monopoly
They own the block and kill your brother for
Therefore, we got the same enemy - what's more, I go on tour
But who do you think picks up the bill?
A hard workin fireman? Chill
Repeat Chorus 2X
Verse Two:
Eighty percent of American business is created illegally
This is a fact I don't ask you to believe in me
If you're really in the drug game to win it
Eventually you're gonna get shot, open a clinic
Again, if you're really in the drug game to win it
Invest in a prison, therefore you can be put in it
Everyone else did it now they chillin
Above the law, while your under the law still killin
One another, wake up my Hispanic brother, my African brother
America's not your mother
Or your father, so don't bother with right or wrong
Just check out the logic in the song
Organize, realize, become unhypnotized
To the lies that your livin for the get high
See many people have forgotten the fact
That America was never ever built for Black
So when some people are gonna run and buy crack
Take the money and put it back into Black
It's only logic, see KRS-One will rock it
With knowledge, education for the people Ill never stop it
Organize and legitimize your business
Remember, everybody else did this
Repeat Chorus 2X"
360232,criminal-minded,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Boogie Down Productions will always get paid
We'll take the wackest song and make it better
Remember to let us into your skin
Cause then you'll begin, to master
Rhymin' rhymin' rhymin'
Criminal minded, you've been blinded
Looking for a style like mine you can't find it
They are the audience, I am the lyricist
Sometimes the suckers on the side gotta hear this
Page, a rage, and I'm not in a cage
Free as a bird to fly up out on stage
Ain't here for no fronting just to say a little something
You suckers don't like me cause you're all about nothing
However, I'm really fascinating to the letter
My all-around performance gets better and better
My English grammar comes down like a hammer
You need a style, I need to pull your file
I don't beg favors, you're kissing other people's [ass]
I write and produce myself just as fast
Keep my hair like this, got no time for Jheri curls
Attracting only women, got no time for little girls
Cause girls look so good but their brain is not ready
I don't know
I'd rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady
So here we go
I'm not a musical maniac or b-boy fanatic
I simply made use of what was upstairs in the attic
I've listened to these MC's back when I was a kid
But I bust more shots than they ever did
I mean this is not the best of KRS, it's just a section
But how many times must I point you in the right direction
You need protection when I'm on the mic
Because my mouth is like a 9 millimeter windpipe
You're a king, I'm a teacher
You're a b-boy, I'm a scholar
If this was a class, well it would go right under drama
See kings lose crowns but teachers stay intelligent
Talking big words on the mic but still irrelevant
Especially when you're not college material
Wake up every morning to your Lucky Charms cereal
DJ Scott La Rock has a college degree
Blastmaster KRS writes poetry
I won't go deeper in the subject cause that gets me bored
It's a shame to know some MC's on the mic are fraud
Saying styles like this to create a diss
But if you listen, who you dissing?
I am a musician
Rapping on the mic like this to me is fine
Cause if I really want to battle I will put out a nine
You can see that Scott La Rock and I are mentally binded
In other words we're both Criminal Minded
We're not promoting violence, we're just having some fun
He's Scott La Rock, I'm KRS-One
Never off-beat cause it don't make sense
Grab the microphone, relaxed and not tense
You waited, debated, and now you activated
A musical genius that could not be duplicated
See I have the formula for rocking the house
If you cannot rock a party do not open your mouth
It's that simple, no phony cosmetics for your pimple
Take another look because the gear is not wrinkled
The K, the R, the S, the O, the N, the E
Say a rhyme for 87 not no 1983
Well versed, to rehearse, in my rhymes I might curse
Originality is first but the suckers get worse
Allow me to include I have a very stable mood
Poetic education of a high altitude
I'm not an MC, so listen, call me poet or musician
A genius when it comes to making music with ambition
I'm cool, collected with the rhyme I directed
Don't wanna be elected as the king of a record
Just respected by others as the man with the solution
An artist of the 80's came and left his contribution
On wax, relax, there's 24 tracks
After years of rocking parties now I picked up the knack
Because everything that flows from out my larynx
Takes years of experience and bottles of Beck's
I cannot seem to recollect the time I didn't have sex
Is it real or is it Memorex?
I'm living in a city known as New York State
Sucker MC's gotta wait while I translate
I hang with real live dreads with knowledge in their heads
People with ambition and straight up musicians
Although our lives have been so uprooted
I haven't included, you can all get zooted
So take each letter of the KRS-One
Means Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
You look at me and laugh, but this is your class
It's an all-out discussion of the suckers I be crushing
So now you are awakened to the music I be making
Never duplicated, and also highly cultivated
Don't get frustrated cause nothing has been traded
Only activated, it came out very complicated
Not separated, from my DJ
You see my voice is now faded
I'll see you folks around the way
Criminal minded"
360233,exhibit-c,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Ya know so we want to clear the air

First for humanity then for the upliftment of Africa
And it goes a little somethin' like this"
360234,beef,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Beef what a relief
When will this poisonous product cease?
This is another public service announcement
You can believe it or you can doubt it
Let us begin now with the cow
The way it gets to your plate and how
The cow doesn't grow fast enough for man
So through his greed he makes a faster plan
He has drugs to make the cow grow quicker
Through the stress the cow gets sicker
Twenty one different drugs are pumped
Into the cow in one big lump
So just before it dies, it cries
In the slaughterhouse full of germs and flies
Off with the head, they pack it, drain it, and cart it
And there it is, in your local supermarket
Red and bloody, a corpse, neatly packed
And you wonder about heart attacks?
Come on now man let's be for real
You are what you eat is the way I feel
But, the Food and Drug Administration
Will tell you meat is the perfect combination
See cows live under fear and stress
Trying to think what's gonna happen next
Fear and stress can become a part of you
In your cells and blood, this is true
So when the cow is killed, believe it
You preserve those cells, you freeze it
Thaw it out with the blood and season it
Then you sit down and begin eatin it
In your body, it's structure becomes your structure
All the fear and stress of another
Any drug is addictive by any name
Even drugs in meat, they are the same
The FDA has America strung out
On drugs in beef no doubt
So if you think that what I say is a bunch of crock
Tell yourself you're gonna try and stop
Eatin meat and you'll see you can't compete
It's the number one drug on the street
Not crack, cause that was made for just black
But brown beef, for all American teeth
Life brings life and death brings death
Keep on eatin the dead and what's left
Absolute disease and negative
Read the book 'How to Eat to Live'
By Elijah Muhammad, it's a brown paperback
For anybody, either white or black
See how many cows must be pumped up fatter
How many rats gotta fall in the batter
How many chickens that eat shit you eat
How much high blood pressure you get from pig feet
See you'll consume, the FDA could care less
They'll sell you donkey meat and say it's
FRESH! For nineteen-ninety, you SUCKERS"

Of the boogie down production
Prevention against sucka MC's
In the event of a real emergency
You would have been instructed
On which jams to play
And how loud to blast your radio
And now, a word from our sponsor
I'm from the Bronx, blast master KRS-One
Provin' that my job ain't done until I get some
More, no need to roar or yell
Cos I can still tell what will sell
And would have sold without yellin over a drum roll
That style is old, so unfold
Blossom, bloom, you got the room
So go ahead and consume
A new era, KRS-One comes better
Bite another lyric? never
Cos I'm too clever, however
I own my own label
Partners with Scott Larock, he's on the turntable
And partner lee smith
I'm exercising a true gift just to uplift
Hip-hop, hip-hop
My voice is like a monster
And now a word from our sponsor
Two, three, four, five, sex, seven, eight, nine, ten
I gotta start this rhyme again
How many words can I find that rhyme
And still keep in mind every lyric must come out on time
Not many but I have plenty
Scott Larock sent me just to devastate any
One, any daughter, any son that comes my way
Hey, you got to go the other way
I represent my DJ Scott Larock
D-nice, the beat box
I only wear Nike's, not Adidas or Reeboks
Many people know me, yet I'm known by few
My name is KRS-One, son
Not two or three or four or five or six
The mix is on Scott Larock and Scott Larock is on the mix
Cool like the air we breathe
Inhale, exhale, perpetrators will fail
As sure as my name is ""blastmaster KRs""
Sit and listen to the very essence of this tale
From the days of prison I have uprisen
To my family members I'm marked down as missin'
Listen, circumstances put me right in the street
With the will to survive, get paid, eat, and sleep
Some weep, or should I rather say some cry
Can't get by so later on they die
Because the strong will survive
The weak will perish
Ignorance is a poison and knowledge will nourish
I love what I got and like what I had
I'm glad, not sad, and I don't even get mad
I get even, myself and some others I believe in
Cos these others are my brothas and perfection we're achievin'
Yes, my name is KRS, my brother is a rasta

360236,exhibit-d,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"All you white people out there that think
You're down with America can forget it.
'Cause they TAX all of us.
All of us one by one.
Just take a look at Leona Helm Helmsley.
Taxed her she's white I believe.
Yeah threw her butt right in jail.
She ain't nothin' but another hoe according to this system.
You ain't pay your taxes hoe get back in jail."
360237,super-hoe,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Scott LaRock is for now the main topic
Not looking at his cuts or cash flow of the pocket
You may not realize it or you may not know
But, uh (He is the Super Ho)
When I say super I'm not exaggeratin'
Datin' for a guy like Scott turns into matin'
He seems to be quiet but I don't buy it
Proof is in the puddin', why don't you just try it
The Super Ho is loose in your section
And he's armed with a powerful erection
So grab your girl and run for protection
Your momma too, cause I like to mention
Whatever you could do or say inside a bed
Scott LaRock has done and most likely said
He doesn't argue with a girl cause yes, he has others
Keep updated on all kind of rubbers
Got ones that are lambskin, others that are plastic
One day he'll open a school for prophylactics
They don't know (he is the Super Ho)
Up in Rochester on DKX
WDKX, now DK-Sex
We were bein' interviewed there live on air
Every girl in the city Scott had an affair
KM in the AM had asked his last question
But Scott LaRock said ""Wait, I gotta mention
The fact that I'm single, I like to mingle""
And one more time bust the fresh jingle
In the field of music I'll always pass by
Girls that claim to act so fly
They always act like it's all about them or their friends
But according to Scott, they all like to bend
Yes, fly girls, shy girls, black girls, white girls
In eighty-seven it's got to be the right girl
If you claim to have a little problem
Well, Scott LaRock knows just how to solve em
If you're a guy a nine'll do the trick
But if you're a girl, you need some flowers
I admit Scott has strange powers
Enticing girls in less than an hour
Or should I say minutes? I seen how he did it
He probably says ""I'm Scott LaRock"" and she's with it
So whether he's a gigolo, tramp, or pro (He is the Super Ho)
Now many people have their ways of expressin'
What they do best, for Scott it's undressin'
Yes, either a girl or some date for the night
He doesn't want to hear that you're too tight
So do not think that Scott LaRock is mean
It's not his fault, he'll give you Vaseline
The Super Ho is loose in your area
Makin' life for girls a little scarier
So if you got a radio tryin' to tape this
Do not keep in mind that he is a rapist
For the Super Ho to be chillin'
Another female out there has to be willin'
So all you tramps and hoes raise your hand
Cos Super Ho Scott LaRock understands
If you're a guy we'll talk about hangin'
And if you're a girl he'll talk about bangin'
If your moms call up, well, I don't know
But uh (He is the Super Ho)"

We're the Boogie Down Productions crew
And due to the fact that no-one else out there knew what time it was
We have to tell you a little story about where we we come from
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
Many people tell me this style is terrific
It is kinda different but let's get specific
KRS-One specialize in music
I'll only use this type of style when I choose it
Party people in the place to be, KRS-One attack
Ya got dropped off MCA cause the rhymes you wrote was wack
So you think that hip-hop had its start out in Queensbridge
If you pop that junk up in the Bronx you might not live
Cause you're in
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
I came with Scott La Rock to express one thing
I am a teacher and others are kings
If that's the title they earn, well it's well deserved, but
Without a crown, see, I still burn
You settle for a pebble not a stone like a rebel
KRS-One is the holder of a boulder, money folder
You want a fresh style let me show ya
Now way back in the days when hip-hop began
With Coke LaRock, Kool Herc, and then Bam
Beat boys ran to the latest jam
But when it got shot up they went home and said ""Damn
There's got to be a better way to hear our music every day
B-boys getting blown away but coming outside anyway""
They tried again outside in Cedar Park
Power from a street light made the place dark
But yo, they didn't care, they turned it out
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
Remember Bronx River, rolling thick
With Kool DJ Red Alert and Chuck Chillout on the mix
When Afrika Islam was rocking the jams
And on the other side of town was a kid named Flash
Patterson and Millbrook projects
Casanova all over, ya couldn't stop it
The Nine Lives Crew, the Cypress Boys
The real Rock Steady taking out these toys
As odd as it looked, as wild as it seems
I didn't hear a peep from a place called Queens
It was seventy-six to 1980
The dreads in Brooklyn was crazy
You couldn't bring out your set with no hip-hop
Because the pistols would go
So why don't you wise up, show all the people in the place that you are wack
Instead of tryna take out LL, you need to take your homeboys off the crack
Cause if you don't, well, then their nerves will become shot
And that would leave the job up to my own Scott La Rock
And he's from
South Bronx, the South South Bronx
The human TR-808, D-Nice
The poet, the Blastmaster KRS-ONE
The Grand Incredible DJ Scott La Rock
Boogie Down Productions
Fresh for '86, you suckers!"
360239,100-guns,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"KRS and Melodie live together with D-Nice and Harmony
Side by side with Rebecca, D-Square, Sidney
BDP!
Yes!
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York
Well
I'm driving my car, cross country
With a hundred guns and about six G
Me driving through a town, me see two cops
They're looking at me funny like they really want stop
Me just turn my head, and gwan on me way
Put hip-hop inna de tape and press play
Me get one block and me hear ""Pull over!""
The guns are in the trunk with a thin cover
They ask me for ID, driver's license prefer
Me ask them ""Was I breaking any law, officer?""
They said ""Oh yes, you passed county line
Niggers in these here parts now is a crime""
I said ""Is that so?"" and cocked back me nine
Bust two shots inna the bwoy head top
His knees just a-buckle and his body a-drop
Me put the car in drive and me did not stop
When I get to New York I'm gonna set up shop
Bwoy!
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York
Me in a hotel, off 95 North
Everything's fine, and yes me on course
Me walk to a bathroom, take a lickle leak
But right out the window I can hear the cops speak
""We have the place surrounded we're about to move in""
That's when I pick up my nine and just begin
Pump! Pump! Pump! First cop a-hit the ground
Pump! Pump! Pump! Second cop a-go down
Me jump out the window trying not to make a sound
Me run to the car, gunfire all around
I start up the engine, bust the barricade
All because illegally I want to get paid
Pump! Pump! Pump! There goes my tire
Me spun out of control, the car caught on fire
Me jump out the car, put my hands in the air
Cops just surrounding me with pistols everywhere
They put me in the backseat of their car handcuffed
Pushed out them chests like they're big rough and tough
A cop come and said ""You'll never sell your guns now""
I said ""It doesn't matter, you'll sell them anyhow
You take the guns from me, you sell them for a fee
Any way you put it they'll get in the city""
Hahaha so still
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York
I got a hundred guns two hundred clips
Going to New York, New York
Fire!"
360240,ghetto-music,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"""If you like the sound of what you've heard so far..""
[KRS-One]
Ghetto music
Ghetto music
Ghetto music
Ghetto music..
You're tuned into that easy listening sound
with a cap and gown, not a CROWN
No glitter, no makeup
Just smashin lyrics, that make up
the be	, D, and the P
You pay for the hits, the advice is free
In this industry, we gotta grow
Commercial some go, but, why'know
just as important as they are
so is the underground superstar (like me)
You gotta ask yourself one question
Do I speak facts, or do I start guessin?
Learn the lesson, before you plan your career
Commercial or underground, where
do you fit, cause BOTH sides write hits
And all is rap, I'll admit
But what I've come to EXPLAIN
is that these people LOVE to play a game
They want to make it seem like YOU'RE WRONG
for writin the reality song
(Don't touch those issues, don't talk about dat
We don't take knowledge rap)
What? They want you on their bases
Cause if you bring out the brown, you're racist
But if you bring out the pink, well wait, it's OK
Yeah, they won't stop it
I guess it's alright to act demonic
I guess it's alright to act demonic
But that's another chapter, in another book
I've come to show a different look
And that look is the WHOLE of rap
Not just the commercial pap
but the UNDERGROUND, that RAW ghetto sound
from which rap music was found
So you can't deny it, you cannot refuse it
I'll be rockin that GHETTO MUSIC
People keep tellin me, ""Kris! You need more radio
Yeah man, that's the way to go!
You gotta be like so-and-so to go platinum,""
then I attack em!
I rhyme for the ghetto, I teach the ghetto
I cannot let go, change up? Heck no
In the ghetto, I stay mellow
We're in effect yo, ready, set, go
FRESH, for nineteen eighty-nine you suckers
Peace to P.E., and the Jungle Brothers
Others, have come, to master the art
They start, with heart, then fall apart
Like a dart I shoot for one target (BO BO)
Ghetto music, yeah they'll never chart it
Cause now in eighty-nine, the purpose of a rhyme
is to strengthen and uplift the mind
Although I'll achieve and achieve and achieve
it's simple, I'll never leave
Cause every time you front for respect you LOSE it
I'll rock GHETTO MUSIC
Ghetto music
Ghetto music
Ghetto music
Ghetto music.."

Every posse wan fi chat, but ju knows dem is wack
Every posse wan fi chat, but ju knows dem is wack
They jump pon the mic, an' wan fi do it like dat
But ahh, now dis a KRS, me nah takes dat
When me open up to work, I put a cape on me back
Then me, FLY ALL AROUND THE EMCEE WORLD
KRS, the article, is not to be [*changes from patois*]
fucked with, ? with, or tampered with
Don't give a fuck if you want to riff
But when you say Kris, already derivative of Kris
My eyebrows lift and that ass I get with (HUH)
As a matter of fact, I attack, hijack
Set back, your career, like a quarterback
that broke his back, my tongue is like a bat
Your eye'll get black, you'll need an icepack (RRRRRUFF!)
I'm all that, come with your whole pack
You'll be prayin to the God of Isaac
So Freddie Foxxx, it's time to get tough [uh-huh]
Just, get on the mic and get RUFF, RUFF
[Freddie Foxxx]
Soon as I flex, cause I'm about to rip up shop
It's the return of the hip-hop master, Freddie the Foxxx
(Bo!) Rappers that see me, don't even speak, just walk
Cause I'm the maddest nigga in New York (hah!)
I see a rapper in the crowd that I don't like
I want to fight, so when I drop the mic
I'ma jump off the stage, bumrush your crowd to whip
(suckers) that want to be pimps
How I heard it said that a pimp'll sell his ass
if his hoe won't, but Freddie Foxxx don't
Cover your chest G, you better wear a bulletproof vest see
Cause I'm about to leave this place a motherfuckin mess
Open hearts on the floor as I explore
rappers that wanted to be more than number four
Number one's a hard spot; either you fight
or get shot, so this is what I got (BO!)
Three Tec-9's, my uzi, ten grenades, my razor blades
and I aim to get PAID!
So who want to step to this, don't come soft
Cause I'ma straight up knock niggaz off (POM! POM!)
And when the cops come to get me
I'ma take a dead body, and bop ten cops with me
I'm sick and tired of hearin rappers talk smack
about who's nice, and who's whack, MOTHERFUCK THAT
They know my style, and my rep, every stage
that I stepped on - I was the rapper they slept on
But y'all rappers keep sleepin - cause when they plant
bombs in your house, I'ma wake you up and punch you
in your motherfuckin mouth, knock your wife out
Take your sons to safety, cause they're just kids
and I want to raise em to face me
And when they get a little bigga
I'ma MARK them little niggaz, and put their fingerprints
on the trigger -- double homicide, call the vice
Another rapper and his family with no life
Yeah you're Mr. Tough and, you're full of stuff and
and Freddie Foxxx caught you bluffin
I got you in my torture chamber and you scream
Oh God damn, it's like _Silence of the Lambs_
but I don't mangle em and eat em
I take MC's to the war zone, and there I defeat em
It gets much worse, with every verse
as the F-are-E-D-D-I-E F-O-X-X-X, HURTS!
Punishes, stomps, smashes, crushes, maims
You suckers know my name!
Aiyyo Kris! I'm rhymin long enough (say what?)
Get on the mic and get RUFF, RUFF
[KRS-One]
This is the year that I go all out (why?)
Edutainment's what I'm all about (and)
I don't eat franks with the sauerkraut (cause)
because I don't eat pork from the tail to the snout
(well kick it) Get on down, to the hip hip hop
Before I start, peace to Scott LaRock! (word)
Now let me drop the style that has action
Cause many MC's don't believe they're rappin
They're lost, crazy mixed-up in their identity
This is not, what hip-hop is meant to be (word up)
I come unique, I can't be beat, hardcore street
for the kids, with a hundred-and-fifty on their feet
(kick it) I don't compete, I defeat and delete ya
then critique ya, all MC's retreat, HERE COMES THE T'CHA
Chewin suckers like Smuckers
Hittin on, sittin on, shittin on, flippin on motherfuckers
Yeah, I'm like the movie _Aliens_
I hide inside your right hand man, when you think you got me
BAM! My head comes out your chest
A mutilated mess of nastyness
Chunks of bloody flesh, yes KRS on the slaughter
Specialize in instant rhyme style, you simply add water
Evian, I pull the string then
RING-DING-DING, DING-DING-DING-DING
Back in the days, I wrote +South Bronx+
The Juice Crew got stomped, lick two shot
POM! POM! Really it was Magic's fault
Always want to diss somebody, he got put to a halt
It's wack, when a sucker DJ babbles on
Soupin up MC's to battle on song
That's wrong, but in any event, I drop the classic
in 1992 the original it ain't plastic
Everybody know, BDP, is fantastic, burn like acid
Credit card plastic, stretch like elastic
Love and respect is the TACTIC
Bam! In your motherfuckin face
KRS in the place
I never liked listening to bitches and hoes anyway
(Fi-YAH!)
[Freddie Foxxx]
Well you know I like hoes, cause I'm a mack
but I don't like the wack tracks, youknowhatI'msayin?
And for all your suckers out there
that underestimate the militant mack, get the BO-ZACK
You know what I mean? (Word) Word!
[KRS-One]
You know why?
Every posse wan fi chat, they wan fi chat, they wan fi chat
Every posse wan fi chat, but ya knows dey is wack
Every posse wan fi chat, they wan fi chat, you know dem a wack
Every posse wan fi chat, but ya knows dey is wack

You can't find it, boy you're still blinded
Why don't you open your eyes and stop DISSIN
Get a prescription to listen
Sit in the class and ask real fast about a FRESH RAP
You're gettin left back, set back, kept back
Get back, I don't accept that material
Your rhymes are artificially flavored like cereal
I like clarity, so when you come here
speak clear and concise and then I might give
a little slack to.. nah, wait - I take that back
If you're wack, I'll slap, FUCK THAT!
Boogie Down Productions back, simply cause we never left
the radical sounds of KRS
What a mess, to roll up and then 'fess
Wild guess huh, you thought you were the best?
But - yup yup - as it always turns out
You get burned out, your rhymes just run out
I immediately come out, BOOMIN dope and
don't provoke, you're walkin a very thin rope
Not even rope, the word I'm lookin for is string
When I sing, I sing to try and bring
enlightenment, yet the suckers be bitin it
Radio's fightin it, the fans be likin it
Your face I'm wipin it, cause your mouth is dirty
You're unworthy to THINK that you can serve me
You heard me? These styles are universal
You need rehearsal, wait, first I'll
beef up the system, rhyth, rhymin, timin, climbin
Then realizing
As producer of this dope record huh
I think it's time we break for a second

Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang
This is KRS-One
Me knew a crack dealer by the name of peter
Had to buck him down with my 9 millimeter
He said I had his girl, I said ""now what are you? stupid?""
But he tried to play me out and KRS-One knew it
He reached for his pistol but it was just a waste
Cos my 9 millimeter was up against his face
He pulled his pistol anyway and I filled him full of lead
But just before he fell to the ground this is what I said
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang
This is KRS-One
Seven days later I was chillin' in the herb gate
But seven days too much when the gossip has to circulate
Puffin sensimilla I heard ""knock knock knock""
But the way that they knocked it did not sound like any cop
And if it were a customer they'd ask me for a nick
So suddenly I realized it had to be a trick
I dropped down to the floor and they did not waste no time
They shot right through the door so I had to go for mine
They pumped and shot again but the suckas kept on missin'
Cos I was on the floor by now, I crawled into the kitchen
Thirty seconds later, boy, they bust the door down
The money and the sensemi' was lyin all around
But just as they put their pistols down to take a cut
Me jumped out the kitchen, went ""buck! buck! buck!""
They fall down to the floor but one was still alive
So I put my 9 millimeter right between his eyes
Looked at his potnah and both of them were dead
So just before he joined his potnah this is what I said
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang
Listen to my 9 millimeter go bang
Wa da da dang
Wa da da da dang
This is KRS-One
I gathered all the money and I ran up the block
I said this is a perfect time to meet with Scott Larock
But Scott is either psychic or he has a knack for trouble
Cos Scott Larock showed up in a all-black BMW
I jumped inside the car and we screeched off in a hurry
And Scott said what is wrong? relax, tell me the story
I said you remember peter? well his posse tried to kill me
I'm all right now because the sensemi' fill me
Scott just laughed, he said I know they're all dead
And just before you pulled the trigger this is what you said

BlastMaster KRS-One, Leo -- the Lion
Cryin MC's they be cryin
When they sizzle in a big pot grease beggin, ""Please, please!""
But I'll be efficient and flexin wisdom cuisine
Then dismiss it as Kris and Kenny
Rockin many, good n plenty
Any MC tests me gets done
Lyrically hung, I surgically remove his tongue
Lyrics by KRS-One
DUCK! Sucker MC's DUCK!
BO! Duck down!
Sucker MC's duck!
DUCK! Sucker MC's Duck down!
I don't battle to lose or win, I battle
To ruin your whole career, yo, watch what you doin
I'm permanent punk, like a metallic marker
KRS-One, but you'll call me Mr. Parker
A pity I'm K-are, you ain't no superstar
Ha ha hee hee, BlastMaster KRS-One be
Ripping up MC's with their meaningless words, why'know
There's more wit, to one of my turds of shit
You ain't shit, you never was shit
So I spit, on your number one hit, now quit!
Leave the poetry, it's just too strong for thee
Maybe we should rethink the strategy see
Poetry I speak, fluently I think youse a sucker
Cause the only word you know is motherfucker
Yo, you don't see a whole race in bondage
No, you grab the microphone and feed em garbage
Yo, everything about me is fresher than fresher
Than fresher than fresh, of COURSE it's KRS
Flashing lyrics, metaphysics, unlike you idiots
Be doing, I'm pursuing, chewing your whole crew
And what you feel like doin, your face they be ungluin
Like a gift, don't step to KRS, you're dismissed!
DUCK! DUCK!
Sucker MC's duck down!
DUCK! BO!
Ree-WINNNNND!!
DUCK! BO!"
360247,poetry,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Well now you're forced to listen to the teacher and the lesson
Class is in session so you can stop guessin'
If this is a tape or a written down memo
See I am a professional this is not a demo
In fact call it a lecture a visual picture
Sort of a poetic and rhythm like mixture
Listen I'm not dissin' but there's somethin' that you're missin'
Maybe you should touch reality stop wishin'
For beats with plenty bass and lyrics said in haste
If this meaning doesn't manifest put it to rest
I am a poet, you try to show it, yet blow it
It takes concentration for fresh communication
Observation, that is to see without speaking
Take off your coat, take notes, I am teachin'
A class, or rather school, cause you need schooling
I am not a king or queen, I'm not ruling
This is an introduction to poetry
A small dedication to those that might know of me
They might know of you and maybe your gang
But one thing's for sure, neither one of y'all can hang
'Cause yo I'm like a arrow, and Scott is the crossbow
Say something now ... thought so
You seem to be the type that only understand
The annihilation and destruction of the next man
That's not poetry, that is insanity
It's simply fantasy far from reality
Poetry is the language of imagination
Poetry is a form of positive creation
Difficult, isn't it? The point, you're missin' it
Your face is in front of my hand so I'm dissin' it
Scott LaRock is innovating, decorating hip-hop
The beat may drop but not like all the others
They just cover while I just smother
Every single stupid mutha; wait wait brotha
KRS-One will have to show another
MC or self-proclaimed king or queen
Or gang or crew or solo or team
That I mean
Business
So tell me what is this
See I come from the Bronx so just kiss this
Boogie Down Productions is somewhat an experiment
The antidote for sucka MC's and they're fearin' it
It's self-explanatory, no one's writin for me
The poetry I'm rattlin' is really not for battlin'
But if you want I will simply change the program
So when I'm done you will simply say ""damn""
So this conversation is somewhat hypothetical
Boogie Down Productions attempts to prove somethin'
I say hypothetical because it's only theory
My theory, so take a minute now to hear me
So what's your problem
It seems you want to be KRS-Two
From my point of view, backtrack, stop the attack
'Cause KRS-One means simply one KRS
That's it, that's all, solo, single, no more, no less
I've built up my credential financially and mental
Anytime I rhyme I request the instrumental
I speak clearly and that's merely
Or should I say a mere, help to my career
I'm really not into fashion or craze
Just the one who pays and how soon I get a raise
You're probably in a daze, acting out of sympathy
Wrote a couple of rhymes and think that you can get with me
But what a pity, I'm rockin' New York City
And everywhere else, you put the jams on the shelf
You as an amateur is outspoken
I'm looking at your face, you seem to be hopin'
That I might stutter, stop, or just mess up
But everything's live that's why I don't dress up
""Blastmaster KRS"" a synonym for ""fresh""
I'm the teacher of the class, I do not pass no test
Got DJ Scott LaRock by my side, not in back of me
'Cause we make up the Boogie Down Productions crew faculty
Get it right, or train yourself not to bite
'Cause when you bite you have bitten, when I hear it, that's it
I do not contemplate a battle cause it really ain't worth it
I'd rather point a pistol at your head and try to burst it
I'm teaching poetry
I'm teaching poetry
Scott LaRock
We're teaching po-e-try"
360248,elementary,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"I hear the same old rhyme the same old style
The same old runner has ran the mile
See I don't know exactly what you know
But what I know is that stuff gotta go
Usually when I pick up the mic
Something ill jumps out my mouth for that night
I like to talk about fact not fiction
I got some fantasy rhymes but just listen
Everything I write is premeditated
Suckas want to fake it I just hate it
Bitin' routines or sayin' somethin' kinda weak
My words are comprehended every time I speak
Or have spoken, no I'm not jokin'
Please don't sleep, I hope you are awoken
Stop! Try this again, you had enough? Say when
I am the man with the six-pack of Heineken
I get tipsy
But never in your life try to dis me
'cause I don't battle with rhymes, I battle with guns
Knowledge reigns supreme over nearly every one
If you take the first letter of what I just sung
You spell my name ""KRS-One""
It's elementary
Elementary
DJ Scott LaRock and I, KRS-One
Our mother's first son and no, we'll never run
From complex situations like you T-O-why-S's
Always talkin' junk, yet in jail, you're rockin' dresses
I have arrived for the purpose of joy
Unlike any ordinary Bronx be	-boy
I will volunteer my services and launch an attack
On you fake educators with your yakety-yak
This is a fact, the teacher is here now in the flesh
Consistently hounded by you MC pests
If you really want to learn from me
Don't waste time in burnin' me
'cause ignorance and inexperience does not concern me
I will emphasize so you will realize and come alive
Never close your eyes, never sleep or you might take a dive
Many people hate me, many people love me
Some are far below me
And you know there's some above me
But this, my hypothesis, to conclude the story
All you fake MC's on a mission, you bore me
I'm the Blastmaster KRS on the mic
Watchin' all these females rock their pants too tight
'cause there's no other creative composition on display
That give a full analysis and rock this way
You will pay, eventually you all will decay
While the DJ Scott LaRock will continue to play
Cuttin' records, drivin' cars, and you'll know who we are
Make a mix just for kicks
And you'll be on our tip
And, oh yes, there's a highlight to the show, of course
You hear DJ Scott LaRock (Go off! Go off!)
(Scott La Rock) (Go off! Go off!) x8
Verse 3:
Boogie Down Productions, no reduction to its title
If you have a headache, toys, go and take a Midol
We have arrived for the purpose of enjoyment
You have arrived to make up for unemployment
You're on it only 'cause I learned just how to flaunt it
I breathed a rhyme upon you like a sickness and you caught it
Quick, get off the tip, trick, you must be sick
Like a doctor here's my bill, I wrote it out with a Bic
Signed my name upon the bottle 'cause you know I just rocked em
But gettin' into battles really isn't my thing
You're probably thinking these are the rhymes for the century
But please don't mention me"

Ridin one day on my freestyle fix
Jammin to a tape scott larock had mixed
I said to myself ""this tape sound funky""
Ridin past the 116th street junkie
Thought I saw denise but I was only assumin
Took another look and that butt was boomin
Did a little trick on my freestyle fix
And I was right beside the girl, she was all on the tip
She said ""hi, dj krs""
She kissed me on my neck so I gave her a peck
She said ""i'm really in a hurry so I cannot wait
If you give me a life while we ride to the ? bait? ""
She jumped on my bike, I said ""huh, what's your stop? ""
She said ""right around the corner to the crack spot
If you buy me a crack I'll know how to act
But if you don't, you might as well step back""
I said ""now how the hell we jump off to this?
I'm doin you a favor, I'm givin you a lift""
She said ""krs, you know it goes""
I said ""yeah, you little.....it seems that you're a hoe""
I did a little trick on my freestyle fix
And she was right on the ground lookin after it
Because...
A girl tried to take my out one day
For a play, not your everyday ? trey?
We walked to the spot, she says she want a rock
I looked in my pocket, didn't have a lot
I said ""you better get yourself a job""
She tried to tell me that times were hard
I told the hoe, I said ""yo, that's not my fault
You need a vault"", I'm out to assault
Any girl I find who try to take my for mine
I'm gonna have to ? pin? it just another time
But..."

Hahahahaha yeah ya don't stop (say what?)
A ya don't stop (BDP in the house) a ya don't stop
(Check it out check it out...Yo D!)
Yo bust it yo yo Kris hold on
Let me give a shout out to some people aight bust it
A Scott LaRock and ya don't stop
A Sammy be and ya don't stop
A Mister Cee and ya don't stop
A Cool V and ya don't stop

Jam Master Jay, and ya don't stop
A PA Mase, and ya don't stop
So yo Kris, my mellow my man yo
Get on the mic and do the best you can
Well, the teacher comes to you, in effect
From a different style, a whole different sect
I inject, force and intellect
When I hit the mic, suckers hit the deck
I come correct and practice what I preach
I don't pimp you or rule you I teach
Come through the doors and slap up whores
Ordering them to put back on their drawers
Cause, I run their pimp
When I leave he leaves with a limp
Shrimp, I got the tartar sauce
Never underestimate the power of the force
of the intellectual KRS-One
I don't think yet my job is done, because
I stand alone while others have to verify
Just why they are thought to be fly
Makin the public believe that they are way up in the sky
Sort of like a rap superguy
But I, horrify and terrify the super duper rap guy
Because you're SOFT as a lullaby
While they sit on their throne lookin
Well I'm walkin in the streets of Brooklyn
Or Harlem and Queens and Bronx and
I'm even out there walkin in Compton
Cause everywhere BDP is schoolin
So anywhere, KRS is coolin
I'm not foolin, cause no, I'm not a fool
Don't act stupid boy, you know the rules
Word, aiyyo Kris, they act like they don't know the rules
But yo, I tell you what
Yo get on the mic and tell em what makes up KRS-One
YaknowhatI'msayin? Huh, and ya don't stop
Verse Two: KRS
Yo, from off the sidewalk I grab the mic and talk
Born nineteen-sixty-five in the state of New York
My name is Kris Parker, KRS-One for short
I slap up crews and rock parties for sport
Lived on the streets about eight years straight
There I got my education and learned to debate
So when I pick up the microphone I know what I'm sayin
Education doesn't come from simply obeyin
the curriculum, of the school criteria
In fact what I learned I found inferior
I'm not a Muslim but I do support them
My Father in heaven taught me and taught them
I'm not a Christian, but I won't diss em
I'm not a Jew, I don't practice Judaism
I'm not a Buddhist, but Buddha's a master
I don't eat beef pork nor Diet Shasta
Reason for this is very simple indeed
When it comes to music everybody's in need
You got wealthy artists spendin money loosely
You ask about the culture, they talk 'bout Gucci
Metaphysics, the science of life
And how to live, free from strife
Walk with ease, and no disease
Understand that I am the breeze
And the trees, oceans and seas
And the be and the D and the P's
Suckers try it, but I don't buy it
When I speak you seek to stay quiet
Shut up! What what? You better stay cool
And heed the warning boy, you know the rules!
Ah one two yeah, and ya don't stop
Ah three four (say what?) and ya don't stop
Ah five six (pop pop) and ya don't stop
Ah seven eight (get down) and ya don't stop
Aiyyo yo Kris, this goes out to all them house nigga
(foot shufflin) moonshine (hamhock eatin) pickled-pig tuggin
(tap dancin) jheri curl activist (program directors)
That don't want to play rap music (that's right, ya know what?)
Yo, ya know the rules
Ha, ha-ha hah!"
360252,the-blueprint,2006,boogie-down-productions,Hip-Hop,"Musty fusty yet so crystal clear
The non commercial set is now here
Brought to you by the will of positve people
K are S plus One equals
Slammin' lyrics and beats unquestionable
The peofessional while I guess that you'll
Grab the album that rocks most on the market
Strong hearted with a target
Bloo and the target is hit
I shot the lyric then reload the clip
Bloo-- another shell hits the ground
Along with the shell my opponents weak crown
--Bloo Bloo-- the title comes after
What a disaster listen to the laughter
Your heart I capture
Cause every lecture has tecture
If you're wack I say next sir
Who's next cause I've got no time for weakness
Only the teacher speaks this
Dialect, which gains nuff resect
Which money can't buy you yet
I don't care cause Boogie Down Productions has both
The most worldwide coast to coast
We didn't do it with the soft commercial sound
Try the ghetto cause I refuse to let go
You see you don't understand I knew it
You got a copy I read from the blueprint
Keepin' it on track
And never wack
Please step back
If you speak the weak rap
Cause I alone can dis your whole pack or posse
Stupid sit there and watch me
You can't stop the original with a copy
Sloppy very sloppy you slouch
Every time I bite you yell ouch
Breakout get lost your throat is hoarse
You lost cause I'm dope of course
--One and Two and Three and Four--
But that comes from years of practice
Anti-slackness anti-wackness
Throw on the glasses and teach the masses
Very simple the question I ask is
How many MCs must get stomped
Before somebody says Kris has no calm
Thousands both here and overseas
If you're soft I say please leave
Here's the door here's your hat coat and mitt

BDP are the freshest!
Worldwide!
One two three, the crew is called BDP
And if you want to go to the tip top
Stop the violence in Hip Hop, Y-O
Time and time again, as I pick up the pen
As my thoughts emerge, these are those words
I glance at the paper to know what's going on
Someone's doing wrong, the story goes on
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
The drama of the world shouldn't keep us so frustrated
I look, but it doesn't coincide with my books
Social studies will not speak upon political crooks
It's just the presidents, and all the money they spent
All the things they invent, and how their house is so immaculate
They create missiles, my family's eating gristle
Then they get upset when the press blows the whistle
Phone calls are made, profiles are kept low
You tamper with some jobs, now the press is controlled
Not only newspapers, but every single station
You only get to hear the president is on vacation
But uh, stay calm, there's no need for alarm
You say goodbye to your mom, and you're off to Vietnam
You shoot to kill, come back and you're a veteran
But how many veterans are out there pedaling?
There's no telling, cause they continue selling
As quiet as it's kept, I won't go into depth
You could talk about Nigeria, people used to laugh at ya
Now I take a look, I see USA For Africa?
Huh
What's the solution, to stop all this confusion?
Rewrite the constitution, change the drug which you're using
Rewrite the constitution or the emancipation proclamation
We fight inflation, yet the president's still on vacation
BDP posse!
One two three, the crew is called BDP
And if you want to go to the tip top
Stop the violence in Hip Hop, Y-O
This might sound a little strange to you
Well here's the reason I came to you
We gotta put our heads together, and stop the violence
Cause real bad boys move in silence
When you're in a club, you come to chill out
Not watch someone's blood just spill out
That's what these other people want to see
Another race fight endlessly
You know we're being watched, you know we're being seen
Some wish to destroy this scene called hip-hop
But I won't drop
Not I or Scott LaRock
Well here is the message that we bring today
Hip-hop will surely decay
If we as a people don't stand up and say
Stop the violence
One two three, the crew is called BDP
And if you want to go to the tip top
Stop the violence in Hip Hop, Y-O
BDP and me
We step into the party top celebrity
Say when we come in the dance, we never have to pay a fee
Cause that's cos we got R-E-S-P-E-C-T
I have this one wife, her name is Miss Melody
Although I'm from the Bronx, she from the Brooklyn posse
I tell ya a little of this and then I tell you some of that
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I wear a hat
Sometimes I'm in a Mercedes and sometimes I'm in a plane
Sometimes I find myself upon the number two train
Some people look at me and see negativity
Some people look at me and see positivity
But when I see myself I see creativity
So if I can create, well then I make some money
Jah man just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid
Jah man just put your hands up if you're out here gettin' paid

Rap music what does it mean
What is everybody in this industry for
What is everybody buying rap for
Why do people get involved in rap music
Rap music number one is the voice of black people number one
Number two it's the last voice of black people
Black people have created every music you hear out here in the streets today
Every single music, rock and roll down
Therefore; in a situation that has, all African music in it
All African music, uh, exploiting itself of it, or coming out of it
All African influence in all it's music
And you have what is called American Music Awards
You have what is called theft

How should I start
If I say stop the violence, I won't chart
Maybe I should write some songs like mozart
'cause many people don't believe rap is an art
Wake up, shake up, hypocrite look alive
Blastmaster krs-one will revive
Four or five million still deprived
When out to survive, wake up and realize
Some people say I am a rap missionary
Some people say I am a walking dictionary
Some people say I am truly legendary
But what I am is simply a black revolutionary
I write rhymes on plain stationary
Mary, mary, quite contrary
Doesn't make sense in my vocabulary
Uncle tom house niggaz, too scary
So they can't be around, I don't do this
For every jesus, there must be a judas
It's the concept of the house nigga, field nigga
The house nigga will sell you up the river
So to massa, he'll look bigger
And when ya bet under a rock, he'll slither
But I'll grab the tail of the house nigga
Pull the trigger and his head I'll deliver
To the court of righteous people
Black, white, or indian, we're all equal
So all ya racist codes I'll decode, explode
And eat you like apple pie a la mode
On a hot day, don't bring me no hamhocks
Cause round the clock, I'll kick their buttocks
All afternoon in the classroom, in the living room
In the bathroom, in the swimming pool
On a footstool, then I'll stop -- nope, april fools!
Whip out the baseball bat and somehow
March your racist butt to moscow
Ya know what I'm saying?
Are there any, are there any intelligent people in the house?
What can I say, o ye of little faith
To think that krs-one has surely been erased
What a waste, my finger points at the face of the human race
They're confused and misplaced
My words are subliminal, sometimes metaphysical
I teach, not preach, you want a challenge? I'll start dissin you
I go philosophical by topical
Hearin the call, ignorant, hot tropical
Ya want a palm tree and nice dope shade?
Only if the universal law is obeyed
Which is ""know thyself"" for better mental health
Yet so many rappers are preoccupied with wealth
On my shelf I got titles
Other artists want belts and idols
World cups from seminars and conventions
Competition and not to mention
The award shows for pimps and hoes
And every other hypocrite that flaunt their clothes
Krs knows, so he just grows
Always sayin somethin different from the average joe's
So I confront them with the biggest chain
But it doesn't rate albums, I believe it is the brain
So I'll remain free while you reign, I'm lovin it
You be the king and I'll overthrow your government
Send your crew to berlin or dublin
I'll out-think em, chump em, and shrink em
Down to ya size, despite the cries
In the face of intelligence, ignorance dies
Dear, it's simple edutainment
Rap needed a teacher, so I became it
Rough and ready, the beats are very steady
With lyrics sharp as a machete
Clap, there's another house niggaz neck
Another soft unlce tom crew is in check
Ego wrecked and rhymes corrected

Question: Why everything you do is fresh?
Answer: My name, Blastmaster KRS
Question: You only write reality, why?
Answer: No time to waste, our people are going to die
Question: Going to die? Please explain this topic
Answer: Some people are using ignorance to make a profit
Question: How do we stop it?
Answer: Throw em in a jail cell and lock it
Question: Why, are people so stupid?
Answer: They got a brain and fail to use it
Question: How did it get like this?
Answer: People are more worried about ass and tits and
little bits of information
The barbarians teach us just to be barbarians in the nation
This new creation
takes on the manifestation of the Board of Education
Question: What's the solution?
Answer: Organized, revolution
Question: Revolution implies killing..
Answer: Whether you fight or talk, the blood is
STILL SPILLING, and we're chilling
Thinking of our history as Elmer Fudd
Everything, black people got in this country
they got through shedding their blood, word!
But they ain't gonna print all that
They too concerned about what you wearin
what kind of Benz you got, or BM
But I think this year
since we knockin all these sucker frauds out,
you might get some press
But when you talk that consciousness -
nobody wants to listen
Word up, it's a crying shame though
I, ah-I tell you this though
if I was talkin sex and all that nonsense
I'd get ALL the covers
Yo Kris, just chill, and interview yourself
That's what I like to hear

Everything you learned in law school
can be taught, when you're six years old
But they make you wait and wait and wait and wait

But what if you can't afford to pay?
You walk around ignorant all day!
The pimp don't care, it's really your decision
Kick up that money hoe!! Oh, I mean tuition

Sittin in a room with a liar, and you must listen

Answer: The concept that turns a rapper, into a dancer
Question: Are you really all that fresh?
Answer: Yes, yes.. YES!

That your third party fire and theft would be no use

One day the Devil was in high good humor for he had created a mirror
Which made everything good and beautiful reflected in it shrink to almost
Nothing, and everything bad and ugly stand out more clearly than ever.
All the little imps who went to the Devil's school ran around with the
Mirror until there was nowhere and no one that had not been distorted in it.
The Devil was much amused, and the mirror itself grinned wickedly.
Then the little imps decided to fly up to heaven and make fun of God and
His angles. The higher they carried the mirror, the more it grinned, until
It was shaking so hard with laughter that it slipped out of their hands
And fell to earth, where it broke into millions of pieces.
And then it caused even more trouble than before, because all the tiny
Splinters, scarcely the size of a grain of sand, went flying around the
World, and whenever a splinter flew into anyone's eye, it had the same
Power as the whole mirror, and made people see everything distorted.
Sometimes a splinter of glass even entered someone's heart, which was
Worst of all, for then that person's heart was turned to ice.

There will be no more bandera no more service will be rendered

It's just that it's not safe to go out anymore

My petty rimes and my nursery rhymes
Someone said, that the sound of a baby crying
Is the world and beauty in the eye of the beholder
But as my heart grows colder, and colder
I just feel so tired
The fridge is empty, the walls are damp, there's no hot water
And I look like a tramp and tramps like us
Baby we were born to walk

360308,pick-up-the-phone,2009,dragonette,Pop,"Come on Cherry Cherry you're still very young
And we've only just started having fun
I'm picking fruit and I choose you, you're so cool
No need to save yourself for someone else to come
So we went completely wild
Kicked over a city street light
Saint Thomas was vandalized
And I'm sorry but I'm not surprised
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of
Oh Cherry Cherry I'll read your fortune
It says here you're too serious and such
But I learned one thing Cherry you should understand
That nothing really matters very much
So we went completely wild
We were married in the Vegas style
And our families were scandalized
And I'm sorry but I'm not surprised
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of
Yeah we started the fire, it's out of control
Painted the town til it was up in smoke
So tie a ribbon round it, let the fighters drown it
And we'll go down in the books
Yeah we started the fire and it's burning up
Everywhere around us, take a photograph
If they ever found us, they'd have us surrounded
So pick up
You know you gotta pick it up
Cherry pick it up
Pick it up
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone
Congratulations, I'm having visions of us
Breaking everything on our way out of town
We're going places you never dreamed of"

And leave that door opened
Get someone to keep us company
Cause I've been making up a list of things I'd do to you
As we would dance on either side of the room
But it's too late, I'd never say it
Anyway, I'm taken and we're both leaving with who we came
Somewhere you're sleeping it off
But I'm wide awake
Chasing a runaway thought
So come on say it!
You could feel it too
Don't hide, you liar!
Some kind of thunder inside
Don't speak, don't breathe
Don't touch the fire
It's gonna burn us alive
I know you could feel it too
I saw you, liar!
Standing off, run away
One look, one touch
We won't survive it
It's gonna burn us alive
(It's gonna burn us alive)
But I've come to close to this
I rub myself against it, oh no!
I can't touch it but I feel it
Can't use it but I need it, Oh!
Oh no, you don't fool me
But I can keep a secret
I can read it like you wrote it all down
And I'm not looking for your love
But we would do it well
And that's the thing I can't stop thinking about
Somewhere you're sleeping it off
But I'm wide awake
Chasing a runaway thought
Just try proving me wrong
But I'll find a way to
Make you confess to it all
You could feel it too
Don't hide, you liar!
Some kind of thunder inside
Don't speak, don't breathe
Don't touch the fire
It's gonna burn us alive
I know you could feel it too
I saw you, liar!
Standing off, run away
One look, one touch
We won't survive it
It's gonna burn us alive
(It's gonna burn us alive)
I wanna wrestle with the savage creature - I can
Well think of jump up and eat you
Some covet cause it's human nature
But I'm coming to the core: Attention!
Some love is got a built-in heater
Some heat is gotta catch on fire
Put it out while you still can
You know, you play with fire
You gonna get burn!
You could feel it too
Don't hide, you liar!
Some kind of thunder inside
Don't speak, don't breathe
Don't touch the fire
It's gonna burn us alive"

Dress up leather, wear every colour
I'm going Rococo with sequins in the summer
So come
Twirl your dresses around
Lift your cotton socks on
And turn your cameras on now for the fun
While I light a fire in your new shoes
If you should smile, look so surprised
While I light a fire in your new shoes
Look out that your soles don't burn to the floor
I light the fire
I light the fire
Buttons are busted, we're decorated
We make an ornament with gold and silver plating
So what's the latest, we raise a fever
We're just all red inside, that's all to see here
Yeah, we're red inside, we're all red inside
And the leg bone's connected to the one in the thigh
We are red inside, we're all red inside

He's mine now
Go and find yourself a guy
Who satisfies ya
Don't come over and hang on mine
Like it don't matter
Take some of your own advice
And let it die now
Don't fill your bluejeans up with big ideas
Haven't you got someone else waiting somewhere?
Whose business is it if you're two-timing?
Go do it in another place with another man
Just get your titties off my things!
(That's my things, don't touch my things)
That's my things, don't touch my...

Hands off him!
Now you wanna make it right
And I'm like whatever
You've never been a friend of mine
So why you bother?
I don't have the kinda time just
To make you feel better
So you can sleep at night
Beside whoever
Don't fill your bluejeans up with big ideas
Haven't you got someone else waiting somewhere?
Whose business is it if you're two-timing?
Go do it in another place with another man

Makes no difference if it's not my guy

So why freeze now this is not a stickup
The reading's not exactly clear, it could be something atmospheric
So we keep going-going
Going up that slope leading to a volcano
Lower the rope, right into a volcano
And if it blows then we'll go out with a bang, oh
Last thing we know is the blast of a volcano
Can you imagine me all dipped in glowing color?
Oh, your great love split up, swallowed by the burning light
While a million years of rock go slipping under
Acting like a stone is so young and just running like a river downhill
But we keep going, going
(Going, going)
Going up that slope leading to a volcano
Lower the rope, right into a volcano
And if it blows then we'll go out with a bang, oh
Last thing we know is the blast of a volcano
See the sky explode and welcome us home

To blow off the roof and let in the dark
So we better get started
And if I were you, I'd let go
And feel it all over inside like a chemical
'Cause to tell the truth
I don't know
If it's ever over
We don't need a cure for the weight of the world
'Cause it's floating round in the universe
Just swing it like it's tied by a string that you hold
And let it go
We could dig a hole right down into
Somewhere as deep as black and blue
And fill it with a crowd and the sound of right now
And we could carve a tunnel under
And find out just how low it goes, it goes
And we run out of dirt on the other side when we see the light
Well if I were you, I'd look up
And find a place there in the sky where there's room enough
To spread it out, and look 'round
For where to land when you come down

But your purity makes my thoughts more unholy
Your heart full of goodness
Speaks to my devil inside and I crave it
Makes my desire insatiable
And you ever so untouchable
Oh I'm the devil you know
I'm the devil you know
And a fire is burning my kingdom below
So why you coming so close
And all your bells are ringing out as you rise above
Oh and I want to believe
You don't know what you're doing
When you open the door
To the devil you know
Go on get up
And walk away
If it's getting too hot
For your cool body
Look I've been trying so hard
Not to really want you
And your bloody sainthood
Oh your divinity only makes me feel dirty
Your heart full of goodness
Speaks to my devil inside and I crave it
Makes my desire insatiable
And you ever so untouchable"

Listen to the warning
The Seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal.
When U niggaz die, where U think Ur gonna go
Everybody saying heaven probably isn't gonna show
Cuz people dying everyday and nobody seems to care
They just say ""That's the way it is. Nobody said that life was fair.""
As I wake up in the morning
Stop
Walk over and grab the
Glock
Take it to the mirror and envision my melon
Pop
The only thing that probably
Stops
A nigga from pullin' the trigger is my son
I think about him sleeping & kiss him on the forehead.
I go into the living room and then turn on the news
The cleanup in the Gulf
Someone shot up a school
A man got shot in the head over bottle of booze
They murdered Dirty Mike
People are fools
Nobody gives a damn
We just be goin' ham and don't do shit over real shit if U really just
think about it
Nobody speaks about it
So where U figure out a revolution will be televised?
Preachers won't even preach about it!
(Chorus)
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal.
I'm not a Christian rapper
cuz cursing isn't Christian
I'm just a nigga on some real shit if U really listening
I feel God gave me senses to speak and act with wisdom
Hell I just wanna share 'em
Haters just wanna diss him
I am that fucking Phoenix rising from the blunt ashes
Almost everything around a nigga is tragic, tornadic.
Sending u hating faggots somewhere back over the rainbow w/ my steel dick in your motherfuckin' mouth nigga...

This ain't a porno or promo
This is the intro
Since Da Nickel rules got thrown back out the window.
Now I'm back up in the game; the game's got back suspenful
Niggaz don't know my name all they just know is just my shit's dope
Lighting up an incense
Smoking on some indo
Working on some dope shit
Talking to my kinfolk
That's for those inquiring wondering what I've been up to.
Before that was Da Nickel
Before that it was Phukk U!!!
And now....

The night was dark and stormy
I just popped in without warning
Came in
Straight through the window
Smoke followed my trail like indo
Outside to indoors
With a flash
Didn't even see me
Creeping up on ya ass
The sound heard by everyone else
Sent shivers
Sounds like somebody just pulled a trigger
Everyone in earshot stops just stunned
Did anyone see someone running with a handgun?
Is the question everyone asks
Not even a mask
All they heard was a blast
Shattering of glass
""Did U at least see the flash from the blast?""
Shards in the dark
Creeping to the window of your bedroom

'Cuz

You're lying on the floor here bleeding
You find yourself having difficulty breathing
At home all alone
Can't even find your cell phone
Something about the way you feel now
Just feels wrong
...But lying down won't make it no better
Swallow the pain
Trying to get yourself together
Coughing up blood
Trying to scream for help
Gonna die from the pain
If you don't bleed to death
This could very well just be the end
As you lying on the floor
Wondering did you ever have any friends
More importantly is this the end
Of your life
You're a goner
By the time you get to Arizona
Say good-bye to it all
As your life flash
You die
Take a bow now
Kiss your ass
Goodbye!

My people came from Africa (shit)
We had all the land
Came to America
They told me that I'm not a man
He said my name is nigger
And then he aimed his trigger
At my wife and killed my first born
As she delivered
They took my god away
And took my native tongue
Took the name that my father gave me
For another one
They said I couldn't read
They told me not to breed
They said I had no vote
They said I couldn't speak
They treat us like some things
They know we once were kings
We went from that
To trying to get respect as human beings
Left us to starve and die
Then filled us up with lies
Split us up in sides
And add some salty genocide
You've got the melting pot
And now it's getting hot
And now your kids can't go to school
For fear of getting shot
So blame the gangs and thugs
Or the kids and the drugs
Or suck it up
And admit this shit was fucked up
From the set-up.
(Chorus)
I though this
Was America
I thought we're supposed to be free
Is this
America
It sure ain't free for me
For me
For me
(Verse 2)
I spell trouble like Mayday
A nigga that you love to hate
Like Oshae or OJ
Maybe that's why I spell America
With three Ks
Or why I spell freedom with an AK
The place where I stay is so love hate
Cuz niggaz hate love
But they love hate
Can't say why they want the nigga dead in me
When they're the reason
Why the shit is even bred in me...
But I could see the cops
Or these niggaz putting lead in me
My only choices are to die or live
Dead-il-y
Don't call the FEDS on me
Two strikes
Don't need another felony
The system's already hell on me
Just trying to live peacefully and legally
In a world that treats me so evilly
Can you tell me what's the difference
When they yell freeze
From when they used to hang us from
Sycamore tree's in AmeriKKKa?

Following yellow bricks

And risk out life and freedom

Haters rule the Earth
The Romans killed Jesus
Now it's they who run the church, I...
Guess I've got a different
Kinda point of view
When I see a nigga do
As the Romans do
Niggaz ask what's wrong with me
I'm wondering what's wrong with you
Asking me
Like my point of view is fucked up
Money is a drug
That done took the place of love
Mind over money
Ideas are money
Get your bucks up
Mind over matter
And nothing matters 'cept
What's on my mind
And nothing's on my mind but money
So I'm on my grind

The situation worsens
I could swear all around
I feel the demons lurking
So when I die
Hope God ain't just some man
Behind the curtain...
A fairy tale
In a living hell
A magic act that taxes me for living well
And that religion isn't
Just a pipe dream
Cuz people ain't never had the courage
To just do the right thing
The universe itself is
Beyond human comprehension
That attaches to our essence
Only if we pay attention
We out of touch
And running out of time
Out of sight
And out of mind
They say Jesus Christ died just to save us
But we afraid to get close
Wonder what we're afraid of...
I we were in his shoes
Wonder would we chose the same road
Or would we chose...

A little piece of heaven
And with that piece of heaven
I learned to count my blessings

Still I did a lot of stressing
Thanks to my baby momma
She still so with the drama
I did my best to make it work
But I can't change his momma
Cuz she can't change herself
So I can't blame myself
I only gave her ass enough rope
For her to hang herself
No more pointing fingers
No more placing blame

What it is and what it was
Is different thangs
No more pressing the issue
No more wetting your tissue
No more conversation

To get out this position
Something's got to give
Cuz to be real
This ain't living

And wish that GOD will bless
I hope you get your head together
Or whatever
But I....

I've got a little boy to look after
And If I die
Then my child will be a bastard

I love you
And think of you
Every single day
You're my first real love
My little man RJ
I know I have my ways
But Randy you're my heart
It might be corny
But my daddy never spoke his heart
So I'm speaking mines
Because I value time
And don't wanna leave you in this world
Without me speaking mines
Unless you know I love you
And know I've got your back
And know when daddy tell you something son
Then it's a fact
You're still young now
And got a lot to learn
You've got your life in front
Don't let the past concern
About your mom and me
It doesn't bother me
It doesn't her
So It shouldn't bother you
Just learn from my mistakes
Don't make the same mistakes
Because I made a few
And no
I'm not including you
You're no mistake to make it plain and simple
GOD don't make mistakes
So to me
You're a miracle
Cuz

Now the expression on my face is just daring you
To push me

Steady as a mountain

Up this mountain
Thinking bout thousands of warriors
Looking to be
Victorious
Failure's not an option
May our deaths be glorious
We fight to the death
Cuz the odd are enormous
Cuz we'd rather die
Full of life
Than live dormant
In this fucked up world
Full of torment
In the concrete jungle
Niggaz can't see the trees for the forest
For hopping past the tortoise
Wanna know what war is
When you feel the enemy
All around
But you don't know his name
But he don't make a sound
Dead bodies all around
There's death to your left
And your rifle might just have
One bullet left
Death is in the air

Cuz niggaz don't scare
Niggaz need prayer
There's a war out there
For a niggaz soul
And niggaz don't know
Cuz niggaz too worried
Bout a niggaz being broke

Now that anything goes
Welcome to the globe
Of Sodom and Gomorrah
Untold horrors
Hoping that I'm not the only one
The sorrah (sorrow)

This is the darkest hour
This is the darkest album
This is the darkest time...
To be a fucking coward
In a quest for power
Standing in the shower
Waiting on change
With not enough common sense
To come in out the rain
I think were insane
Riding on the short bus
Trying to take short cuts
This ain't a dance track
This is a war cut
For these war times
So keep your peace (piece) tucked

Is my soul pouring
Through the ink
In the pen
The elephant in the room
Hid in plain sight
They call this the soundtrack
To end all life
Like fanfare for the return of
Jesus Christ
A classic case of rising from the ashes
More beautiful
Than you ever imagined
Replaced the critics blanks
With a Brandon
Now Enters the Dragon
Watch the world burn
Brought the gasoline and matches
I wish I could buy
All my enemies a casket
Each
All filled with bullets and molasses

Is awakening a beast so tragic
Another beautiful mind
Descends into madness
Curtain call

When the crime is war?
The rhymes I deploy
Are much more
Than meet the eye
Hear me with your eyes
When you see it with your mind
Now that you envision it
Now witness it
Wake up from the dream
And smell what the business is
I'm getting more annoyed
The more that I'm ignored
The button caption changes
To panic when I press record
Hip-hop unholy war
Blood and gore
From shore to shore

And niggaz wonder why I keep it so hardcore

And cross to many borders

When I go
How will I be thought of?
Live long enough to die the villain
Or die the martyr
Will they remember me
A coward or a Sparta?
I could die today
But you could die tomorrow

I do not have a life
I'm not an OG
Don't live the street life
Ain't never did a bid
Not on my third strike
I don't ride clean
Don't even own a bike
I don't slang dope
I just live my life
I don't frequent at the clubs
Or the titty bar
I don't do hood rat shit with my niggaz
In and out of cars
I don't do dance songs

You wanna dress like me
You wanna brag about unprotected sex

I say I'm keepin it real
But I'm not telling the truth
Nah!

If I lie then why are kids having kids
With the teachers
But we afraid to have that talk
With our kids
So we're the last to know
About a sexual offense
And straddling the fence
Seems to be our sole defense
That is
If we acknowledge if the problem
Even exists
I'm sure the kids do
But they don't go run telling it
When they get bullied
For showing any sign of intelligence
Ignorance
Encouraged
Common sense
Discouraged
Kids are killing kids
And have the nerve
To call it courage
Cuz they heard it in a song
And a nigga made it sound cool
Seems it's like we gravitate
To everything that's NOT true
I think we try to be good
But get lies from all sides
So when we try to be true
All we tell is more lies

Don't believe everything a rapper tell you in a song

Why don't we save the time

Call up

Why do we even
Try to bother with trust?

The make-believe and the faking
The demon seeds and the Satans
And the problem child

While you constantly getting jealous
Need to have your ass at home
Paying someone else to watch your child
You need to watch your own

360373,tearz,2011,da-grym-reefer,Hip-Hop,"Verse 1:
This world is full of niggaz
Who be plottin and scheming
That's why your babies
Who were born anges grow to be demons
Semen
Contaminated with a gangster mentality
Forming assholes with a hater personality
I wouldn't bring a life into this world for shit
And anyones who disagrees
You can suck my dick
And that may have made alot of listeners pissed
But I see life as a bitch that's why I feel like this
You may use love as an excuse
But then it doesn't exist.
You may say love is the truth
But then you're bound to get dissed.
And some may listen to this
And may say I depress
I say you missed th whole point of my shit
But nevertheless
There is a hole in my chest
Where my heart used to be
With each day that passes
My soul dies within me
It probably cries within me
But if it does
I can't hear it
And every breath that I breathe
It probably tortures my spirit.
I feel like me and this world
Already had incoherence
Should be expressing endearment
But yet it comes out as indifference
I feel like what is the difference
Whether I'm loved or not?
Picking the petals off flowers
Either you love me or not
And being planted like crop
When young was one of my fears
Used to cry me to sleep
But I ain't shed tears in years
(Yeah rest in peace to my nephew Breeze,
My nigga T-Bone
and all the other fallen soldiers out there.)
Verse 2
Pour my soul through this mic
Through this pen I cry
Whoever said You suffer for your art
They did not lie
Sometimes I wish I could just die
So I could get it over with
But I'd rathe make a million under your nose
Without you knowing shit
Pick up my gun
Tears hit the paper
Made the ink run
I'm not suicidal
I just say shit to make you think some
Cuz I don't fear
If all my peers do not agree with what they hear
My only fear is going to hell
When I just went through it here
Not enough words can express
Growing up in the hood
One thing's for sure
A nigga learns to take the bad with the good
and look for the good in the bad
And either happy or sad
Can't make a change with complaints
And I'm too humble to brag
And for this
I stay
Forever underrated
Misunderstood
Should be good
But it's an understatement
Paying my dues I've been caught up on my payments
Trying not to be the fool
And leave the pool on the pavement...."

Too bad bitches

To juice for the riches
I don't give a fuck about your looks
Or the shit you can cook
As far as rap
Fuck the radio, a Dj and a hook

I spit my shit twenty
On a scale of one to ten
Fuck a friend
Fuck a family
Motherfuck humanity
I don't give a fuck
Because nobody gives a damn for me
Blasphemy I spit
In this world full of bullshit
Hard for me to believe in the preachers in the pulpit
Living on faith
I'll be dead
Before I get shit
To be sincere
Fuck life
I didn't ask to be here
Rather no-show
Cuz I don't know when I'll leave here
Mothefuck trust
Cuz I've been nothing but decieved here
And when I leave here
You might be shot
Or then again
Maybe not
Cuz niggaz been making up plots

Took her ass on a date
Straight to the Knights Inn

A big booty red-boned ho.
Her name was Michelle
She loved to give a nigga head
She sucking and fucking doing her thang
She never scared.
I done spit my game
See the bitch was feeling me
Wanting me to fulfill all of her freaky fantasies
Got her to the house

Was goin out the frame
She sucked my dick from the back
And I forgot the hoes name
And that's a shame

Hold your fanny in my hand

Beat it
Mistreat it
And never eat it

Get to sucking on my nuts

Don't want no divas

Though
They like to bend over
Make they knees touch they elbows
And let the dick
Touch the back
Of they fucking throat
When I saw that ho
At the Bull Market #5
I knew right then
I had to have them thick as thighs
I ain't gon lie

Tell your nigga you've been kidnapped.

I'll break ya face and hurt ya feelings

Bustin nuts on bitches lips

Paranoid sleeping with my finger on the trigger

Wanna bust caps at bustas like pinatas

Wanna go over town and spray you fuckas

Pop you with a fucking pump
Lock you in the fucking trunk

Somebody needs to give my ass a hug quick
Too late
Now it's only hat that I'm in love with.
My cure is beyond some hugs, bitch.
Beyond some thug shit.
Wanna be down put you underground
Feeding you to bugs, bitch.
I'm too disgusted
With motherfuckers to trust shit
Losing my mind
But not enough to fuck with your kind
A style from hell
Satan ghost-wrote me this rhyme
Told me to kill myself and you
At the same time.
Grab the nine
Mesmerized by the way that it shines
Or the tech nine
Delfonic chronic
Didn't I blow your mind this time
Lose your mind
Follow mines
Bitch and go the same route
Go to hell
Go to church
Blow the preachers brains out
Didn't mean to say that shit

Dicect me like I worship voodoo
Cuz I go by three aliases
Just to confuse you
But still to have the nerve
To still think I'm a fool to.
Niggaz think that they know me
Cuz deep down I'm a cool dude
When I see 'em in the streets
I look at niggaz like ""Who's you?""
It's not that I'm stuck-up
It's just the shit that I've been through
That happens when a motherfucker tries to kill you
Fuck how cool you try to be
That shit unlocks an ill you
That wants to walk up and down the street and kill dudes
Even more
When it seems like nobody feels you
I was taught
If something ain't for you
Then it's against you
If niggaz watched your every move
Then you'll probably be pissed to

Instead of gotten like Bin Laden
Strapped with bombs and missles...

Be ahead of the times

And they think it's amusing

Developed a thirst for vengence
Living, sinning with no regrets
In me there's no repentence
I come from the home of lynching
Churches with no Christians
The innocent over-sentence
Requires me to spit this pimpin'
Like a felon's required
To teach school in Memphis
I'm in this to pimp the system that under-estimates
My wisdom
Envision riches
Money over bitches
The law
They be the bitches
The streets they be the snitches
My mission:
To stack these chips
And poof like three wishes
Simple as this is they still call me vicious
Cuz I don't ignore the disses
I split wigs
And make
All you player haters sicker
Than sickle-cell-syphillis
Infamous like Scarecrow
No girlfriend
I scare hoes
Niggaz hate and stare like hoes
Niggaz like me don't care though
I've got a pair of those
Nuts
That the world can suck
Nina quicker than Peter and not afraid to bust
Sluts

Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here

""Yeah, Yeah, Dawn Jay, Dawn Jay,

I was trying to find a reason
To tell you that I'm sorry
I've been lying all this while
So that you never worry
Baby, meeting friends or working late
It was just a story
Girl I lied, made you cry
I said my car ran outta gas I had to
Walk till I was late
No reception on the phone tried to
Call but had no change
Baby, I never meant to lie to you
But the truth was hard to face
Girl I tried, not to lie
You can call me liar (liar)
I was too weak to face the truth
You can call me liar (liar)
I couldn't tell you I'll leave you soon
Girl I had my reasons believe me
I never want to see that you cry
You can call me liar (liar)
I really love you that's why I lied
You can call me liar, liar, liar
You can call me liar, liar, liar
You can call me liar, liar
I really love you that's why I lied
She cut the call when she was on the phone
When you picked up the line
You got so mad and asked me who's the girl
I'm sleeping with behind
Baby, I had no words to say
So I guess I will try
Not to lie... it's the time...
I said my car ran outta gas I had to
Walk till I was late
No reception on the phone tried to
Call but had no change
Baby, I never meant to lie to you
But the truth was hard to face
Girl I tried not to lie
Girl I never tried to cheat and lie
But I guess I had no choice
Now I guess it's time to say goodbye
So baby hear my voice
Girl: ""What are you doing with my boyfroend ?
Why are you ruining my life ?
Who are you ?""
Doctor: ""Who are you ?""
Girl: ""I'm Dawn Jay's girlfriend""
Doctor: ""By the way, I'm Rebecca...
I'm Dawn Jay's doctor
I think you should have a look at this...""
I was with my doctor all this time
When I came home late
She said ma brain is dying (dying)
I only got four months to wait
Girl I had my reasons believe me
I never wanna see that you cry
You can call me liar (liar)
I really love you that's why I lied
You can call me liar, liar, liar
You can call me liar, liar, liar
You can call me liar
I really love you that's why I lied"

Before I lose it and blow again

Sink it in 'til I forget
Threat after threat, again and again

You were lost and alone. You called My name and as promised, I came and saved you.

I never said there's a chance for us
So there's no need for you to catch feelings for me
What will it take for you to give up?
How could you possibly love so much?
But there can't be anything between you and me
[Chorus]
There never was a time when I loved you
There never was a chance that I gave you
So how could you be loving me when I never loved you?
Why can't you just leave me alone?
Don't try and break up my happy home
What must I do for you to see
That there's no you and me?
One year has gone by
So why do you keep on calling me?
I told you the last time
That me and you could never be
Time has gone by
And still you try
To get with me
No questions why
Don't try to find
A place with me
[Bridge]
[Chorus x 2]

And everytime I close my eyes
I feel you coming back to me (to me)
I didn't have a chance to kiss and hold you
As long as I really wanted to
But I can hear your sexy voice in my ear
Saying it won't be long until you're here

And everytime I close my eyes
I feel you coming back to me (to me)

I said this can't be happening to me
I wasn't ready for the challenge

And the pleasing of my fans and my friends still had demands on me
To find out who I was did not come easy
For I felt like I was in this race alone
Until I heard a voice speak clearly
Saying there's a winner within me
And I was charged to beat the odds and the victory I'll say
The winner in me pushed me forward
When my problems would push me down
The winner in me with found my freedom
When my surroundings kept me confound

There's one reason that I'm still here

And you can walk right out of them as soon as you are in

How there were no V-day heroes in 1973
How we sailed into Sydney Harbor
Saw an old friend but couldn't kiss her
She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land
And she was like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty, till they found their chosen one
And their legs were often open
But their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains
And the legal pads were yellow, hours long, pay packet lean
And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been
But the car parks made me jumpy
And I never stopped the dreams
Or the growing need for speed and Novocaine
So I worked across the country end to end
Tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend
Held a job on an oil-rig
Flying choppers when I could
But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend
And I've traveled round the world from year to year
And each one found me aimless, one more year the more for wear
And I've been back to South East Asia
But the answer sure ain't there
But I'm drifting north, to check things out again
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
Only seven flying hours, and I'll be landing in Hong Kong
There ain't nothing like the kisses
From a jaded Chinese princess
I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night long

[Chorus:]
Went to a party, tried to drink myself happy
The steaks were washed away in the rain
Finished up in bed with an old acquaintance
She'll never be my friend again
And everyone was asking me where's the little woman
Rolled home before the rain could stop
I've been sitting for days reading pre-Christmas papers
With my heels on the table-top
[Chorus:]"

Painted doll, on a painted stage
She's just a one-man Punch and Judy show
For caliphs twice her age
Painted doll, on a painted stage
The more they look at her
The less I see
The more they look at her
The less I see
It's a tricky situation when some
Parasite has got my painted doll
And she's got me
Lookin' down Sydney Harbour in the rain
My pretty baby's slappin' up another vein
If this is gonna be her final wage
My heart may never see this world again
She's my little sick salome
And it's breakin' me in two

I've got a deal for you"

I settle down to prime time limbo
When all the boys are gathered around
Shouting Ita'a on TV

Somebody goes to close my window
Keep the noise of the city down
Get a dose of integrity
Every week, in every home
She got wholesome news for the family
I believe, I believe, in what she says
Yes I do
I believe, I believe, at the end of the day
Her magazine'll get me through
Ita's tongue never touches her lips
She could always be my godmother
And though the desk-top hides her hips
My imagination's strong
She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen
I'd like to take her out to dinner
But when I think about the places I've been
I'd probably hold my fork all wrong
Every day and every night
She's the only one we can depend upon

Her conversation flowed like treacle from a tin
And Chicken felt like some kind of fool
Oh Yeah!
Her every move
Is a lesson in street ballet
And they speak her name in cheap hotels
From Turkey to Marseillaise
Seduction seems to hang in the dressing-room air
But no-one knows just whos seducing who
She puts it out wave after wave
And never seems to miss the slightest cue
Outside in the wings
The curtain-boys cry lonely
Their one true love is Daskarzine
And for her theyll all die slowly
Oh babe, she says, weve got to die sometime
Its the sweetest thing we do
Why not die from month to month
With my touch to help you through
Now Chicken left the room feeling angry and cold
Young Stetson looked reluctant and lame
Daskarzine had him neatly pidgeonholed
And he was just clinging blindly to his name
Im Stetson and I aint so bad, he kept on saying
But his mind was trapped in some kind of cage
He had failed at the ancient art of role-playing
And was fighting to leave the bleeding stage
On the radio
A tenor saxaphone
Cries sweet jazz poetry
And it breaks on Daskarzines facade
Of false serenity"

And whistles at the icy rime
The cattle float like thistle-downs
And God is on the edge of time
Somewhere behind a siren wails
The freight-train soars above the rails
The traveller, hes hard as nails
As the train sweeps down the line
The salmon Seasons here to stay
And etched into each shoulder-bone
The mark of Cain is on display
As stone above each measured stone
Old Dresden burns above the breeze

And Bergman's face in black and white

I've had the Vietnam cold turkey, from the ocean to the silver city
And it's only other vets could understand
'Bout the long forgotten dockside guarantees
How there were no V-day heroes in nineteen seventy-three
How we sailed into Sydney Harbour, I saw an old friend but I couldn't kiss her
She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land
She was like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty, until they'd found their chosen one
And their legs were often open
But their minds were always closed
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains
And the legal pads were yellow, hours long pay-packets lean
And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been
The carparks made me jumpy and I never stopped the dreams
Or the growing need for speed and Novocaine
So I worked across the country from end to end
I tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend
I held a job on an oil-rig, flyin' choppers when I could
But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend
And I've travelled round the world from year to year
And each one found me aimless, one more year the worse for wear
And I've been back to South East Asia, but the answer sure ain't there
But I'm driftin' north to check things out again
Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone
And only seven flyin' hours, till I'll be landin' in Hong Kong

Boss found hung in office
Could not stand the pace

People come and go
Wandered down along the river last night
Call me romantic, I say I couldn't sleep
Until the first-light struck me down
Padding homeward on the inside lane
Early morning, freeway's cool and quiet
Dodging rubber stains
People talking in a seaside bar
I ain't sentimental, but Lord
Sometimes I get that gypsy urge to travel far
You know I'll disappear some long weekend
Find a mangrove landscape
Stretch out along some busted jetty
And forget who I am
You go to move
You got to go
You go to be somebody
You got to roll
You got to stop
You got to change
You got to make a little money
And be a little strange
And one long day
Is all it takes to steal her heart away
One long night
And it's allright, you've done it again
Soft, low words
And slender ladies, beneath the cafe fans
One long day
laid by dreams
Cotton dresses, a Spanish border town
Dreams so far
From the subway, the crowds heading home
Close each day
In technicolor, a million miles away
One long night and you're alone

City ways
Life goes creeping on
Sometimes
I get the blues"

And a new song every mile or two
Yeah it's just what I do.
Chorus:
I'm a rider, across the great unknown
That horizon, don't need to get no closer
Let the wheels keep rolling, 'cause wherever I go
Cross the blue, cross the sky,
I know I.. I'm finally home.
Back when I was young
I thought my life was a race to be won
So I ran and I ran like a man with his eye on the prize.
I was all about the next best thing till I figured it out
Now I know, I don't have to arrive to be satisfied
Chorus:
I'm a rider, across the great unknown
That horizon, don't need to get no closer
Let the wheels keep rolling, 'cause wherever I go
Cross the blue, cross the sky,
I know I.. I'm finally home.
If life is a highway I broke down somewhere
Between everything's here that I should have been there
After all these years I can finally see
Smack dab in the middle's maybe not such a bad place to be, not for me.

One kiss too deep

And calling everyone you know
You're reaching for the cigarattes
You gave up long ago
You wanna go and get drunk somewhere
Turn it off and just not care
For a little while
You're runnin' over what went wrong
For a hundredth time today
You wonder if another thought
Will ever take its place
You're feeling like you're
Trapped inside
Your own bad dream
One that's never gonna end
But here's the funny thing
My friend
You feel like you're gonna die
But you don't
You think that the world
Will stop
But it won't
And it's the darnest thing I know
The sun comes up
It's another day
And your heart still beats
And you see
Hey
I'm still breathing
Take it from me
These little victories
Are all a heart needs
Photographs you tore and have
it scattered on the floor
Letters where he swore
His love mean nothing anymore
You can't imagine how to get from here to there
But one day you'll know where to start
That's the power of the heart
You feel like you're gonna die
But you don't
You think that the world would stop
But it won't
And it's the darnest thing I know
The sun comes up
It's another day
And your heart still beats
And you see
Hey
I'm still breathing
Take it from me
These little victories
Are all a heart needs
The dog still barks
And your shower's hot
And you burned your hand on the coffee pot
So like it or not
Gotta say
I'm still breathing
Take it from me
These little victories
Are all a heart needs!"

I just want the life you stole from me

I'm crashing down
I'm fading out

Is it yours or mine?
Oohhh

Hiding the truth

I don't see how we put up with this
Time is slipping
Put out my hands

To keep it all the same
But you've walked right in and ruined what we've got
No that's not hot
And we're tired of making promises that we can't fulfill...
On the other side I walked out of line
You never had a chance
Falling under pressure
Falling to an end
So now you've got a new game
And no, we don't wanna play
I've set myself above you
Now you're like everyone else who just want to mess up our lives
Well keep in mind that your little tides are just wasting time
Let us live...
On the other side I walked out of line
You never had a chance
Falling under pressure
Falling to an end
Without the mask I've got you pinned around the floor
You find me and take me away
I've got my advantages

That cabernet didnt hurt my cause as I stumbled down the rue
Not even half as drunk as these strangers I pass
Stumbling in and out of bars as they smoked cigars and laughed
I dont even think anyones from here anymore
Well its pouring in sheets down on the bayou
And were dancing out in the quarter under the lamps
Red wine and codeine are coursing through our veins
And we never wanna go back home again
Its all art and war if its written about
Tell me what else could ever really last
Trepidation and devastation are all that remain
Of those things we thought wed learned from years that passed
Everything else just fades so fast
When its pouring in sheets down on the bayou
And were dancing out in the quarter under the lamps
Red wine and codeine are coursing through our veins
And we never wanna go back home
Dont it make you feel so helpless
Sometimes it makes you feel so lost
Your loves all I got baby
The things I thought Id never say
Are pouring from my heart like la la la la la
The things Ive forgotten are all but a few
Just a stain in the back of my mind
See I remember theres something girl
But Im never sure just what
So I just sit here looking for a sign
One that I may never find
Well its pouring in sheets down on the bayou
And were dancing out in the quarter under the lamps
Red wine and codeine are coursing through our veins
And we never wanna go back home when
Its pouring in sheets down on the bayou
And were dancing out in the quarter under the lamps
Red wine and codeine are coursing through our veins
And we never wanna go back home again

She drunk dialin', drunk dialin'
At the same damn time that she drunk drivin'
When I answer the call, heard the people wildin'
In the background ""What's that?"" ""Oh, we alright!""
Now she start laughing, brakes start screeching
She starts screaming, heard her car crashing
Ah shit, I start asking what the fuck had happened and she don't answer
I start panicking, running to the car
But I gotta get the keys and remember where I parked
And I got to hit police and to tell 'em she involved
In an accident, I don't want her to be harmed
So I'm speeding, and I'm weaving
In the middle of the street 'round 3:10
And I'm knowin' that the clock is ticking
But I'm hoping that I can get there and I beat it
At the scene of the crash and I leave in a flash
And I didn't even take all the keys out the dash
Looking at a flipped SUV in the grass
And a couple broke trees with the median smashed
Ah, ah jeez this is bad
Ain't nobody moving, ain't nobody screaming
Ain't nobody sitting in the front anymore
I assume they were thrown from the seatbelt
Now the ambulances pull in, and the EMT's they all sprinting
Found bodies burnt in that backseat
And that driver seem to be missing
They started searching and sniffing
Looking at me with eyes that ask questions
I ain't have any answers, though
And so they started getting aggressive, like
""Where the driver at?""
""Do you think there's a chance they survived the crash?""
Just smiled back
""And the windshield didn't even have a crack
How the hell in God's name they MacGyver that?""
Then a siren flash from behind my back
I turn around, they were clowners behind a badge
Heard a couple rounds from a fired gat
And I hit the ground quick and then fired back
Ah shit, what was I involved in?
Who the hell was the woman that I called in
And how the fuck I end up in a crossfire with assault rifles and marksmen?
That's one cop down, two cops down, cry for a second then a few more rounds
Everybody dead, but my boo right now, now I got to make a move right now
I don't wanna be a victim, I don't wanna talk, I don't wanna be a witness
Or accessory to no murder 'cause I fuck with all the wrong bitches
Now I just wanna forget this, skip town then I go on living
But the problem is I'm involved with her

Yo Kendrick you inspired me man, lets go
Yeah, visions of Che Guevara just staring at me
A fifth of people but legislation is barely Latin
Yea, we got a handful of senators but no president (nah)
'Cuz the politicians ain't acting like representatives (nah)
And they send the census in to check on us and then censor us
They see us all as illegals, white people keep on resenting us
They build that tension up in your mayday, on that May day
Officers sought melees and they kicking us with their pay-lays
And the pay days ain't racking killing us like some pioneers
Open fire like cowards, aggression is just a sign of fear
And they shot an immigrant dead, I seen him just lying there
And another one hit in the head they don't even try and care
Indentured servants, living conditions worsen
Got us waiting inside of Home Depot to see who working
Who do you think picks all them vegetables that you purchase?
Ten of us in tenements trembling with no furnace
Construction workers, house keepers and servants
Mommy got a degree but she works with laundry detergent
And Latin businessmen harassed by all the minute-men
You from the third-world then you a second class citizen
If your black or brown and them racist judges ain't backing down
And if you refuse them, the you get bruises from there abuses then they smack us 'round
And the want to love our food and our women, but hate our Spanish sound
They don't want us in school with they children, they kick our asses out
They're kind of missing the modern sense of the races
First the C.I.A will come and then the corporations
And then the U.S puppet, government inauguration
They rape our resources and exploit us for our labor
We flee into the states in search for better lives and wages
And work below the minimum because they don't got to pay us, right
We getting sick but we dont get no medication
We stay out of the hospitals avoiding deportation
So I ain't funding no IRS, why invest in that INS
When they want to see us all lying dead
And the cartels'll run by the feds?
The War on Drugs is just a war on us
So authorities can horde us up and keep the borders boarded shut
They makin sure they get their cut and that they caking
A flat bed truck is just a modern day slave ship
They make more paper if their workers got no papers
And they ship us off before we plead our cases because they got Hiiipower
Fuck we supposed to look up to man, George Lopez?
Get the fuck out of here
[Verse 2: Grafh]
Uh, yeah, visions of Martin Luther looking at me
'Cuz he had a dream and it as it seems I had a dream
But mines flooded with demons dreaming they should attack me
While I look at Michelle and Obama looking happy
I got the same smile he got
Called him the kettle black
Nah I'm talking about a tea pot
Anything for the nigga especially anything we got
Them walls look strong, them shits is made of sheetrock
Nigga you can't suit and tie me
I'm Huey Newton, you trying to do karate
While I'm shootin' shottys, you stupid, is you on Mollys?
I'm ruthless, assume a cum laude went to school just to party
The truest and found the Illuminati in the student body
I'll assume their probably using computers to crucify me (Judas)
The Giuliani's, you and Romney finna work it out, do pilates
Stretch cutie (yep) until the feds shoot me
If u don't like what I said, sue me
White cops beat a black mans ass, they dont get fired
They get demoted to death duty, yes truly, they pussy
They probably rock a vest to watch a Wild-Wild West movie
The hood is the stage but the sound check tooleys
What used to be nooses are now neck jewelries
And I still got my chains on
Just another statistic or just another Trayvon
Just another beat for me to talk about race on
Just another nigga trying to pull the racecard
Just another flashy ass rapper in a racecar
Fresh to death, best dressed in the graveyard, work it mama!
Black girl, you don't even focus
You want to model, but all you show is emotions
The insecurities showing all of your poses
Your such a beautiful soul and you don't even notice
You don't even know this
But white girls on the magazines make black girls one point of your noses
This is where the truth drops
I ain't good for all of the self esteem issues you got
When I'm trying get your boots knocked
Butt-ass naked in tube socks
But you ain't looking for truth
You on Google looking for 2Pac
You too distracted, the feeling of feeling inadequate
You adapted, you need me to tell you you attractive
Baby, I've been a victim of racism
This cop told me I'd probably make great chicken
And I'd look great in that upstate prison
I wanted to spit in his face
But then he gripped the thing on his waste
And I had became the victim
Change the game if you can't change the system
Think bigger, think smarter, get gudda
I never hate I lust to indulge in culture
I could love any creative way, I love my brotha
But black is beauty and that's my color and that's hiiipower

And I done gained so many enemies, my friends don't seem so sincere

And never gonna say what I like to say
And if you text the wrong bitch, then she can screenshot your whole life away

Now that's karma and I'm never gonna end up penning with them guys
Can't tell if it's my karma or a blessing in disguise

Makin' money off of the drugs that's gotten my aunt and my cousin addicted
That's karma, I'm living it and I pray to god for forgiveness
So when I pay for all my sins that I just can't keep up with the interest
I used to pick on my sister for datin' chicks
Now the man she fell in love with, she's takin' care of, he's sick

Quit school and now my mother still working them triple shifts

Take another swig of jack and take another hit of weed
And pop another fuckin' Ambien so I can fall asleep, that's karma
There ain't no way to cross it off or cancel it
When it comes for you, you take it like a man and handle it
All the sins I've carried out and buried in the past

Took the money from the trap, hit the booth on 'em
Said lemme give this a crack, I'm tired of slingin' that crack
I started spittin' this crack and it grew on 'em
First bookin' was a wrap, word to Brooklyn, it was packed
Man, it happened in a snap how I blew on 'em
Had the haters face blue on 'em, watch face blew on 'em
Bitches blew on 'em, niggas tried to race the whip
And I blew on 'em, shit fast dude
Remember that fast food fiend, well she clean now
Flo' model gone, flat screen now
Livin' in the condo of her dreams now

And even with the sin in me
He rescued me and took it away
So that's my song
Of how you love me
And you gave your life to set me free
O how amazing that you would love me
And you would shed your blood for me
It's by your love that I am saved
It's by your mercy I'm forgiven
It's by your grace that I'm alive
And I am cleansed
It's by your love that I am saved
It's by your blood that I am forgiven

You have revealed the good in me
I never knew what was inside
Until you gave the key to my heart
It was you, it was you

one too many in my head
6 pack went down only 12 minutes from dead
in a car crash scene or head on collision
where i lost all my feelings and most of my vision
riding much too slow on a retard bus
but this is the way that i go

im on fire ill shoot to the moon
got no family
got no home
and if you push too hard i just might slip
and if you stick out the plug
you know im going to trip
yet you burn going down
yet is stick in your throat
i smile when you cut my last ray of hope
do you know that you hurt
do you know you feel good
do you know it some times
i sure wish you would
just bring on back
and give it away
i paint another black smile on another black day
its all i got
its all i can say

Cut myself and scream for their insanity
Wake up to this nightmare that will never end
The main attraction of this twisted master plan
Trust nothing but pain to get me through the daze
Sleep with one eye open not to be their prey
Fist against my face they bring me to my knees
The pressure's crushing down so hard
I can't break free
When I can feel my skin crawl
When I'm about to crack
The hunger for revenge
gives me strength to stand
I will be your deadman
With nothing but this blood on my hands
Stuck in your ""wonderland""
I just want to make you bleed like me
Everyday goes by without a second thought
Living in a perfect and controlled project
A puppet of their sick perversion's appetite
Will I be trapped inside this hell until I die?
So what if no one cares
Enough to make a change
I give my bleeding heart out for one reason
I will be your deadman
With nothing but this blood on my hands
Stuck in your ""wonderland""
I want to make you bleed just like me
So make me your deadman
With only poison in my veins
Stuck in your ""wonderland""

With a bad bitch standin bout 5'8
Around my way
Where I stay
Nigga I rate
Cause I skate
Like Stevie Williams
Tryna reach a million
Niggas showin love when I leave the building
Sold out shows at east pavillion
Probably with your bitch if shes appealin
My car in the house, why I need the ceilin?
If she at the crib, then he is drillin
Run up on me then the heat is spillin
Why you mad nigga you can barley feed your children
If that's your girl why is she revealin
Her deeper feelins
By be and stealin?
This dick in her
Then fix dinner
Id put my log in
But I don't hit inner?
What's wrong, use the brotha that be the big spender
Pussy nigga, you should go and switch genders
You a female, I get weed mail, got so much work I need 3 scales
Tell ya what I go and get detail?
Then hit Houston's I eat well
But I gotta ride with the 45,
They don't like me and I don't know why...
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me...
They lookin,
Police think they cookin
I sell it but I shouldn't
If I was rich, trust me I wouldn't
I'm not a women beater, but Keisha is who I'm pushin
Sold a hundred pounds, only one of them was tookin
If I see em then I'm bookin, like I got a show in Brooklyn
Found some powder and some Kush'n
And a pistol in the glove department with a loaded fuckin cartiridge
For cowards that's woofin?
If they paid me a million to be you for a hour I wouldn't
I'm just a boy in the hood, who got that Cuban Goodin'
I sold it for the five even though they said I couldn't
They call me Mr. Tax-the-block, first not cause I rap a lot
I see that I can rap a burn way faster than I rap a block?
Plus this thing on my hip force a nigga to have to hop
My partners like mechanics, you should see how fast they jack a car
They try to tap my phone, so I threw my celly out
And when I leave the crib mad, can somebody tell me why?
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me...
Suckers hate so they screw face
I'm high to def, no blue ray
I'm shy as hell no lupe
I'm bobby cox, I'm two brave
Ride around in my new shades
Clock two tres, for my crusade
All my bullets fly with tips, just like T, I do clay
I'm on the way to the UK
Niggas do say I'm the new Jay
I'm so polished, low mileage
I'm a Freshman, but I don't go to college
And I don't own a stylus
I was on the violet
When I'm on the pilot
Like a DVD, when I feed the streets
My songs is burnin like Eazy-E,
Now you mad cause your girl wanna be with me
And you know I'm a bang her like a Jeezy beat
I can see you hatin, you don't need to speak
You can have her back, I don't the freak
Before a little nigga even get a chance to reach his peak
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me, sideways, sideways, sideways
Them haters lookin at me...

I keep a circle like a roller rink
I'm a kush addict, im a doja fein
I got partners in the pen and some niggas in the gutter
Guess you can say I'm bowling green
But I ain't from Kentucky
Got a big booty chick with a frame like Buffy
Getting brain like a skully
My bitch roll up everytime we finish fucking,
'Cause she's trained like a puppy
I couldn't give a damn about a lame nigga trust me
Haters talk shit but they better not touch me
RIP to the homie M-bone
Nowadays niggaz can't even do the dougie
Without a hater trying to leave you bloody
While you smoking Mary Jane with your buddies
So I keep a Smith like my first it was Lovey
'Cause they wanna ride on me like the frame on a huffy
So i smoke weed just to ease my mind
But it's hard to complain when your're G5 blind
This is for the potheads who be 35 buying
Gettin so high you can see Mount Zion
Where I'm from I'm E lot of Eastside Giant
'Cause I won the championship for the best blunt roller at least 5 times
(Hook)
First I split the blunt
Then I dump the guts
I ask the person standing next to me
To hold my cup,while I'm rolling up
Rolling up,rolling up
Security on my neck,but I don't give a fuck
I can't believe they tried to throw a nigga out the club,
Just for rolling up,rolling up
(Verse)
I'm out here tryin' to stay alive
Rolling 'til the day I die
Smoking on a Juicy J, pulled up bumping Playa Fly
We driving all the fastest whips
And I gotta half a zip
Riding with my gansta boo she
Open like a bag of chips
She's so fine she don't have to strip
Grab a stack I have to tip
After that I had her back
At the bachelor pad with a sack of piff
A trapper's gift ,the sexy hoe with the ass and hips.
Who come over to smoke a blunt
And let a nigga smash and dip
(Hook)
First I split the blunt
Then I dump the guts
I ask the person standing next to me
To hold my cup,while I'm rolling up
Rolling up,rolling up
Security on my neck,but I don't give a fuck
I can't believe they tried to throw a nigga out the club,
Just for rolling up,rolling up

[Verse 1:]
Some people say I've turned Hollywood
If I had a chance man I probably would
I thought y'all would be happy for me
But niggas hate it when you make it out the hood
I ain't scared to say I am a changed man
Shit I had to switch the game plan
From hangin in the trap, slangin with a strap
For three days straight same shirt and the same pants
They say never bite the hand that feeds you
But they didn't say that they would kill you with the same hand
I'm trynna tell you man I ain't playin
I was raised by some gangsters, everyday was gangland
Prince a lame nigga never
I don't take it personal I blame it on the devil
I've been through a lot you feel the pain in my records
Yeah I've changed, but I've changed for the better so
I told my momma I wasn gon' do this
Cause I'm just that real
You talkin' about real shit man
Real issues
It's all the same thing
Yah
[Verse 2:]
Y'all call it changin', I just call it growth
Y'all the main reason that a nigga gotta smoke
I'm a prince, I can't see myself dying over dope shawty
I'm tired of going to jail lying under oath
I used to keep the work in the lining of my coat
I had the dubs and the dimes for the low
I used to get the whole thing for the 55
29 for the spliff or 25 for the O, Oh
The hustler's still in my DNA
If it wasn't for hip hop I don't know where I would be today
A couple years ago I got signed to GOOD Music
But trust me that wasn't my first time seeing Ye
I remember taking trips to A-Z
Now I'm in the same room with Beyonc and Jay-Z
Cause I got a vision for the ghetto, K-P
Now I'm making money, money never made me, shawty
Yah
I grew up to this song right here man
you feel me?
Yah
listen close...
[Verse 3:]
People try to slander my reputation
Some of y'all should be sued for defamation
They say we living in the book of Revelations
Y'all can go to hell cause heaven is my final destination
I've been made my reservations, so try praying for me shawty
Instead of hatin'
I'm out here by myself, trying to help the nation
I do it independently like the declaration
I don't do it for a profit I do it cause I'm a prophet
I'm an ivy league student born working on my doctorate
I do this for the group home and kids who are adopted
Cause ain't nothing sweet around here except for chocolate
Been a real nigga, I was never phony
In the church was the only time I gave a testimony
So if you hatin' on Cydel, trust me I don't fault ya
If you feel what I'm saying shawty meet me at the altar like"

You callin' her up she missin' like Ferris
And really I feel you niggas embarrassed

I be with Common and John, simply clockin' the dough
I be with CyHI, and Pusha-T, all the hoes wanna look at me
Getting paper like the books you read, bitch ass niggas can't fuck with me
And let's not even mention bitch, you ain't talking money don't mention me

You can act like yall don't understand what I'm elocuting'

Try me Glock by the genitals
Trust me it's not intentional it's a difference between a gangster and a criminal
Cause real gansters can't do breakfast club interviews

Met an old man with a clean watch
He fronted me a whole pound of mid
Cause my partner had the cream rocks and he had the lean locked
Green Glock like the ones the Marines got
In the Bible better known as a slingshot
My sister asked me, ""why you always rap about your gun?""
Do you know how many niggas I done seen shot?
Yeah I know it kinda give you somethin' to think 'bout
That's why I smoke 'til I get the pinkeye
It keep my self esteem high
I remember back in the day I used to think I had a mean pops
He said, ""You can have anything you dream 'bout""
I want the house with the mezzanine box
So I'm sellin' what the fiends buy, fuck sellin' bean pies
Tryna stack them green guys, talkin' Yao Ming high
Now I'm sendin' green dots
You know you the man when they bring swat
What's good of bein' rich when your team not?
I know some real street niggas who don't think stop
So talkin' shit'll get you seen by
Swing by your house with them things out
Treat you like you're havin' a divorce with your wife

CyHi!
[Verse 1]
It's been a hike to the top, feel like I'm writin' for Pac
Prynce uniting the block, plus I'm exiting to watch
Whether you like it or not, I'm a titan to God
Pull up my speakers, it's kicking like Tina and Ike in the car
And if I like it I swipe it, it's bought
This is what you get when you put me and ice in the pot
I murdered your flow and get away with it
Just give me a knife and a mop
My bitch looking better then yours, would you like if we swap?
I remember writin' letters to these chicks like
Circle you like me or not, now they like me a lot
And if your bitch fucked your partner, my nigga, your wife is a thot
[Hook]
Whether you like it or not
Whether you like it or not

I've been most likely to pop
Since we was motorbiking with Joc
Had to fight for my spot

[Verse 2]
Boy, I was raised by them wolves
Boy, you was raised by a fox
Boy, you was raised by your granny
Boy, I was raised by my pops
But I got all of my game from a gangsta from out the Chi
Can't be fightin' with cops
Police always gon' be part of the streets
Whether you like it or not
So I tighten my plot
Had to switch up my look
Man this was just my Versailles
Y'all gonna make me tell on myself
Man this pro-black shit just a disguise
You niggas more flashy then bitches
I see y'all just like to get caught
Spend your nights on the cot
The judge give you life in the box"

We've been waiting for your damn album for years man
What the fuck is Kanye doing
How about you get the fuck up and get something done
Drop that shit
If I were you I'd stop being a little bitch
Grab an AK, load that shit up, get out there and drag Kanye's ass out
[Sample]
Shake me down, not a lot of people left around
Who knows now, softly laying on the ground
[Verse 1]
Hey Ye, do you know what it feel like
To really be signed to you in real life?
Have you ever wrote a song
And you know you about to say something wrong but you still right?
I hope when I'm done that we still tight
But why wasn't I on the cover of the Complex?
You must've seen what I did to Funk Flex
Ya Sean my nigga but I'm coming after Sean next
Sit the fuck down Mr. West, I ain't done yet
While you're in your little Lambo on Sunset
I'm riding with a gun next to me
And it sounds like a little boy playing with a drum set
And it hold a hundred rounds
Cause when you come around niggas quick to gun you down
You'll be found on the other side of town somewhere, nigga
(Softly laying on the ground)
Get the fuck up

In my life I have seen people walk into the sea
Just to find memories plagued by constant misery
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground
Their eyes cast down fixed upon the ground

Welcome to Def Jam
OK, everybody on the fucking floor
You and you by the double doors
That was three shots and it holds 15
So that means I got a dozen more
Now that everybody's on one accord
I'ma tell you what I'm coming for
I want a new million dollar deal on my pub
In the pretty brick house like the Commodores
Oh now everybody's getting kidnapped
Take you back to your crib while your kids nap
And if your wife walk in, start screaming in my ear
Then the bitch is getting bitch slapped
I'ma make it look like a mishap
Cut the TV on so they won't hear this shit clap
And I've got two guns, they gon' think it's suicide
Cause you shot yourself with this strap
(What the fuck CyHi what are you doing this for?)
Cause nobody want to listen to the kid rap
OK, my nigga Pusha shit snap
Nah I'm lying man that shit's crap
OK, Teyana got a fat ass
But she won't let nobody in the clique tap
And there ain't gon' be no new Yeezy album
Cause he in the the trunk with his mouth taped and his wrists wrapped
*mumbling* Shut the fuck up nigga! Shut the fuck up!

Midnight, seems so nice to me
It's the start of a new day
And there's no place in this world that I'd rather be than right here
With midnight and you
Right on baby
Right on
CYHI!
[Verse 1: CyHi The Prynce]
It started round 1976
Back when white folks was the only ones selling bricks
A little mary jane was the most you got arrested with
They hit you with some charges but it really never stick
Back when my daddy was bumping Earth, Wind and Fire
Blowing 'erb from the earth and the wind wants to hit the fire
We wasn't selling them shawty, we was just the buyers
This was back when blacks first started getting hired
Then something perspired in the early 80s
Ronald Reagan introduced us to that perfect lady
If you cook it right its just like a cooking rice
Now your pockets looking right then you bought your first Mercedes
Now people getting addicted, mamas having early babies
The streets is getting crazy so you bought your first .380
And thats when niggas started dying every night
So go and sell some weed cause nigga this shit can carry life
I'm here to bury white
[Hook]
I'm here to bury white
I'm here to bury white
I'm here to bury white
CYHI!
[Verse 2: CyHi The Prynce]
Fast forward 1990 is the year
It started as a hustle, niggas made it a career
Now we fucking bitches, got paper up in here
Niggas killing in the 90s thought the 80s was severe
All them leaders in the hood, they took y'all from us
Fucked around and gave them all football numbers
Like rap shows, niggas was getting booked all summer
Them foes don't give a fuck about ya
Throw that book at yo momma, your honor
Imagine growing up without a father
Section 8 your family always gotta ride the MARTA
Selling drugs was the only way I got a Starter
Jacket, and some Jordans thats what the television taught us
And our daughters
Missing with no amber alert, probably with some little boys
With they hands up her skirt
Her momma dancing, going to work
Even got married twice
Cause the first husband got indicted for that Barry White
Thats why I'm here to bury white
[Verse 3: CyHi The Prynce]
Now it's the early 2000's and the streets grew violent
From the baking soda and the see-through Pyrex
Mixed with Viola, be careful when you meet new clients
For the love of money they'll creep through silent
All you hear is police blue sirens
He used to play ball, went to a D-II college
Dropped out, met a plug from overseas who's supplying
Whoever thought niggas in the streets knew science?
How we get them bricks if we never own the boat?
They give you more time for hard than for soft
But on the low, the laws were made against us
Thats how they Willie Lynched us
Cause we only sold crack, we was never known for coke
They say it ain't over till the fat lady sings
But it's crazy how your own parter can hold a note
Better than Kelly Price just to save his petty life
Instead of giving you Barry Sanders, they gave you Jerry Rice
Thats why I'm here to bury white

Let's sprinkle some crack on him and get outta here"

To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
[Verse: CyHi The Prynce]
Throw your A's up, peace down, I-20, eastbound
All I smoke is loud, if we talkin' 'bout how my trees sound
Darris pull the track up, TEC gon' lay the beat down
I was on my groove 'til Molly said ""Let's eat now""
Last week I ran game on her, girl who had a frame on her
I gave her my number, she don't call? Shame on her
Plus she ain't have no ring on her, my partner said
""CyHi, you got some weed? Cause you always got some stankonia""
That's when I got that call, like somebody tryna pull a prank on yah
She's like ""I wanna smoke, but all I got is some bad purp""
This the chick from last week, I guess I'm not a bad flirt
Meet me outside of Patchwork, but I gotta stop by Zack's first
Shawty wanna fuck Mr. Never-Had-A-Wack verse
Say she passin' Leather Street, cruisin' like Penelope
Sound like my favorite melody, fidelity, no jealousy
So if you keep it cool, we as smooth as Raphael Saadiq
This what I tell a freak

To take a breath and take a chance
I'd walk a thousand nights to change the world
Where to go? When to start?
Who to trust? What to say?
Found them all, just need someone to share

Ain't so strong, I ain't so strong to go
Living in the past is not the way to live
I wish you could hear me say that I miss you
Why were we there back to back?
Why were we there face to face?
I must be the light when you're in the dark
If you lose me somewhere, and your tears are in the air
I will ring a bell until you feel me by your side
Looking up into the sky, looking for the reason
Why I'm here, and why you can't be here
Who's to hate? Who's to blame?
Who's to hurt? Who's to love?
Who just asked 'Why we can't we be the same?'
Try to believe walking down the lonesome road
Ain't so far, I ain't so far from you
Staying the way you are means solitude
I wish you were here and shook off my fear
Why were we there back to back?
Why were we there face to face?
I must be the light when you're in the dark
If I lose you somewhere, and I'm still hanging in there
I will ring a bell until you feel me by your side

There's the peace when you're at war
Heads or tails, You and I
Light and dark, Ups and downs
What has been in the mere goal? What's there to divide us?
If you're hurt, cry and say 'can't you see in you my other half?'

And say my name
the only consolation
Is you remember me that way
With the butterflies
And the happy times we made
I throw the question to see if you feel the same
Because there is nothing
To replace you"

On the winds of hope
You'll find your wings
And your always free to begin again
And your always free to believe
When you find the place that your heart belongs
You'll never leave
You and I will always be
Celebrating life together
I know I have found a friend forever more
Love is like a melody
One that I will always treasure
Courage is the key that opens every door
Though you may not know where your gifts may lead
And it may not show at the start
When you live your dream
You'll find destiny

I dabbed my skin with sweet perfume, the one you helped me choose
I did my hair the way you like, up in a simple twist
You touched my face to take away an eyelash that I missed
You said ""Let's not go out tonight, let's not go into town""
And as you kissed my neck, I said ""We can't let people down""
And now the evening's over, I don't know what to do
I watched two people fall in love, and one of them...
Was you
And now we're lying only inches apart
Though it might be twenty miles
And it's a quiet kind of dying inside
As I see your radiant smiles
The air is loaded with things we cannot say
I try to hold you, but you sigh and turn away
I tell myself we're not estranged
But in one evening, everything's changed
You held my hand as we walked in, each detail I recall
I moved around the party making small-talk, very small
You were soon in conversation with a girl I didn't know
She reminded me of someone else: me, ten years ago
I found you still there two hours later, long since time to leave
I wonder, did you know I saw her hand upon your sleeve?
Then you drove home or was it me? The journey is a blur
I watched two people fall in love, and one of them...
Was her
And now we're lying only inches apart
Though it might be twenty miles
And it's a quiet kind of dying inside
As I see your radiant smiles
The air is loaded with things we cannot say
I try to hold you, but you sigh and turn away
I tell myself we're not estranged
But in one evening, everything's changed
And now two people lie beside each other in the dark
One sleeps, the other cannot, and dissects each chance remark
The satin dress upon its hanger shimmers like a ghost
To illustrate the transience of things we've loved the most
The silver shoes are in their box, not kicked aside in haste
And as you turn the lights off, your kiss is strangely chaste
Now our familiar sanctuary feels terrible and new
I watched two people fall in love, and one of them was you
And now we're lying only...
And it's a quiet kind of...
The air is loaded with things we cannot say...
I tell myself...
Everything's changed."
360937,cheap-flights,2011,fascinating-aida,Not Available,"We received an invitation in the post one Monday morn'
To attend our cousin's wedding in the town where we were born
The do was back in Kerry; so wishing to be frugal
We trawled the 'net to find some decent travel deals on Google
Cheap flights, cheap flights, cheap as they can be,
Bedad we found an airline selling flights for 50p.
(Diddly aiden daidin daidin dai)
Well we clicked on to the website and were mightily surprised,
To find the actual cost wasn't quite as advertised,
We'd forgotten airport taxes, had also to be billed,
But a bargain is a bargain and begorrah we were thrilled.
Cheap flights, cheap flights, Stanstead to Tralee,
It isn't every airline offers flights for 50p,
(Diddly aiden daidin daidin dai (x3))
After studying the website we decided it was best,
To pay priority boarding so that we'd sit three abreast,
(Three abreast, that's the best)
And of course we'd all have luggage, so that's an extra cost,
And then we paid insurance in case our cases might get lost.
Our cheap flights, cheap flights, it's obvious to see,
There must be extra charges when the flights are 50p,
(Minya, minya, minya, key change)
At last the flight was booked, with all of the additions,
We'd read the reams of smallprint, of terms and conditions;
And then picked up the charge for using VISA which was drastic,
'Cause how the feck are you supposed to pay if not with fecking plastic?
Cheap flights, cheap flights, we paid the fecking fee,
Because by now we were committed to the flights for 50p,
(Diddly aiden daidin daidin dai (3))
(Someone's being diddled and it's us, so it is)
(*Ochone, ochone, aah . . . )
Now I don't know if you've tried looking at Stanstead on a map,
But checking in at 5am is a fecking load of crap,
It's packed if you try to catch a train or underground,
So a taxi to the arse in the world was more than 100 pounds,
Cheap flights, cheap flights, we should have gone by sea,
There's no such fecking thing as a fecking flight for 50p,
(Feckity feckity feckity feckity feck, feck, feck (x2))
Then at last we reached the airport where we had to pay a fine,
The fecking feckers charged us 'cause we hadn't checked in online,
And finally aboard the flight there's an extra class of tax,
'Cause the fecking fecking feckers fecking charge to use the jacks,
Cheap flights, cheap flights, I think you must agree,
That only fecking gobshites think there's flights for 50p,
(Feck, shite, feck, shite, feck, shite, arse)
(Feck, shite, shite, feck, feck, shite, arse)
(Feckity Feckity Feckity Feckity Feckity Feckity Feckity Feck)
(Feckity Feckity Feckity Feckity Feckity Feckty Feck)
Sad verse
Well finally we landed and tried to shuffle up the aisle
But the steward sent us down to the back with never a hint of a smile
And as we heard his annoucement our hearts gave a terrible thump
If you haven't prepaid to use the steps you'll have to feckin jump
Cheap flights, cheap flights you're harking on to me
you're an eejit (idiot) if you think a fecking flight is 50p
FECK"

He told me I could drive, it I said Brian you're a star.
We drove down to the boozer for a vodka and a fag then of course we had celebrate the purchase with a shag.
We go dogging,
We go dogging,
We're a treat for any passers by out jogging.
We do it 'cos we've found that when people crowd around it is somehow more profound when we're dogging.
(Spoken)
Oh now well some of the older members of the audience my have a little bit of difficulty with this one.
I just say hang on in there and think the meaning will shine through.
Bill how are you doing.
Anyhow if you are still a little bit in the dark at the end.
Just ask a young person or emm...Google.
Just don't take your computer for repair immediately afterwards.
(Sung)
Well we drove down to the far end of the car park back of Asda.
A threesome was hard at it in a sporty little Mazda.
It made it more exciting as they pressed against the glass.
And when Brian got his torch out you could see right up her arse!
They were dogging,
They were dogging,
Believe me they were more than merely snogging.
But though her cheek were parted she spoilt it when she farted and we wanted to get started on OUR dogging.
(Spoken)
Now how are the older members doing now.
Not finding it too impenetrable?
Those of a sensitive disposition, leave now...
(Sung)
Well we rushed back too our car 'cos we were randy as two goats.
But being late november we had on our duffle coats.
We should have stripped off first before getting back inside.
'cos disrobing in a smart car isn't easy have YOU tried?
We were dogging
We were dogging
In the struggle poor old Brian tore his frogging.
Our Apparel was misguided 'cos when our heads collided Brian's manhood then subsided, but thats dogging.
Well I admit this was a setback but i wasn't beaten yet. 'cos i'm really very handy with my man's beef bayonet.
I quickly had his flagpole up responding to my touch.
And next thing I was upside down and staring at the clutch.
We were dogging,
We were dogging,
Oh the heat was on to stop the windows fogging.
Thank god for plastic sheeting well one must protect the seating.
'Cos the fabric takes a beating when your dogging.
Well by now a crowd had gathered it was cheering fit to burst.
An Brian was close to peaking though he likes me to come first.
My legs were out the sunroof as I really hit my stride.
Then Brian promptly stopped and cried ""The Rozzers are outside!"".
We were dogging,
We were dogging,
We were so alarmed our arteries were clogging.
But we took it on chin when the coppers with a grin said:
""Can anyone join in with your dogging?
Well as you can imagine Brian and I were thrilled to bits.
I love to feel a coppers truncheon in between my tits.
My ecstasy was mounting I was feeling so alive,
When who should wander by but a bloke from channel 5.
He likes dogging
HE likes dogging
He signed us for a series he was flogging.
So watch out for Brian and me and the odd Celebrity,
We were shagging on TV likely dogging.
Oh we'll be dogging
We'll be dogging
Oh think of all the limelight we'll be hogging,
Well the credits show my hand massaging Brian's gland,
The Presenter's Russell Brand, lovely dogging!"

For ages she wandered in the forsaken wilderness
searching for life-forms
She found nothing but a dire emptiness

Whirlwinds of sulphurous smoke
torrents of lava, vapour & clouds
terrible thunders tore the mantle of Earth
unquenchable fires consumed the ground

Is anybody wants to change?
I've often been afraid
To say what think
because all around me there was the fear of knowing
Look in the mirror beyond your eyes
To understand who you really are
and what you're doing here
This time there's no turning back
Can't wait for you
There's no time
I want to shout out loud to the world
I want to hear my message even if it hurts
What is right or wrong?
And who are you to judge anyway?
I built a wall of pain,
I built love that's not only in my dreams
Look in the mirror beyond your eyes
To understand who you really are
and what you're doing here...
This time there's no turning back
Can't wait for you
There's no time
I want to shout out loud to the world
I want to hear my message even if it hurts
And I want to teach you, to talk to the changing world
show you how beautiful it is..
Waitin' for the day when we'll unite without war or pain..
Do you think you are not strong enough,
well you've been strong enough to hide all this time
This time there's no turning back
Can't wait for you
There's no time
I want to shout out loud to the world
This time there's no turning back
Can't wait for you
There's no time
I want to shout out loud to the world
I want to hear my message even if it hurts"

So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me,
Who's be coming at the ill?
Fuck them, I'm a disease.
I put my money where my mouth is,
They be lying through their teeth,
Our window be mistaken, I still ache like a pagan.
So fuck them, they don't go as hard as me,
I don't raise the bar so high, no satellite can find me,
They can keep chasing their dreams until I clap them out the sleeve
Gets pissed that they faded, my name they been cremated.
Lies. You've been guessing out them hoes, which are bullshit,
'cause you've been kissing on your balls with your small dick.
Look, I got my willy up.
And the camera's on, but now you call me wrong on life, that's why Harry's on.
Door signs and a proof big, two times my hun'
I ain't shutting off my time, I'm just letting my shit hang on light
Off the size of red cage I saw nine in like drizzy
This time I'd be on the game like Chris Brizzi did to Ree-Ree.
That's just D A to P P Y, I'm doing me G
Them ring tone rappers ain't got no credit, if one rings around, that brings one later.
Peace cake, soft and sweet, I'll piss on them, they all tie their seats
I shit on them, mighty freaks, they'll never catch me on the sun bath.
'cause no one cares about what the fuck was made in Chelsea,
The only way is the streets, don't care what no one tells me,
Skied off, once in, two shots, none left. Ten men, one pet. Ten times there?
Pussy roll on my carpet, 'cause the king of the jungle just tore that piece out the market,
They talking shit on the record, then why exhaust?
Doing us the dirty thing, is time to flush, 'cause the fucking thing's on it.
You solve it, you finish all, you dickheads be quiet,
I'm starving my face and I'm taking pussy, you on a diet.
You the type to go to Gucci? They caught up high just to try it,
They got picture, post it on Twitter and don't even buy
You don't hustle, you just listen to nipsy,
The only strap you only see is on the top of your kick
I go jump once before and you can even nor stinchy,
I got them on my shit back, and it wasn't my fish,
You see my chains link to my pride if you take what comes to my life
We get our sign, not even my toilet will let shit slide
Now let that book in mine and bring that pair around with that dick
If you only see the shape of that clip, suck it, I'm your prick.
So now you wanna know,
But where was you when I was broke?
Now I see love you've never shown,
So why you think I'm bading?

360982,intro,2012,dappy,Hip-Hop,"And they dont know a thing about me,
They dont know a thing about me,
They dont know a thing about me,
cause they dont know a, they dont know a.
They dont know a thing about me,
Dont believe a word you hear about me
They dont know a, they dont know a
The ones who know you the least, are always the first to judge ya
But they dont know a thing about me,
Despite what they say, at the end of the day
What do you expect? we're only human.
Cant exactly stop them from assuming
Its time they learn a thing about me,
So heres the truth, this albums full of fire, fire.
All that I can be, is brutally honest
And I dont wanna sing no more,
So Imma switch it in, five, four, three, two, one, off.
I fail to say some shit and tie it on my skin
But when theres so much to address, tell me where the fuck do you begin
I think Ill start with my community,
When I see Cameron I should grab him by his neck and raise him up like a uni fee.
How can these greedy bastards put our taxes in their pockets?
Fuck an MP, to me that just stands for maximum profit.
ain't my fault, Im from a jungle where them animals love to smoke meth
Hit the can, chase the dragon and die of slow death.
This middle fingers to the system trying to hide the fact
That were poverty driven, I should take Boris on a road own test.
Take him to the track, stick him in a hat
Show him how to plant trees and cook crack, now that's a dope share.
That's why we hate court, but we love NFA
Im glad I smashed the paparazzis camera off the floor today
Thats rock star shit, they all know Im living a life,
But the money couldn't change me, thats why Im still on the hype.
Im just a man with a Visa, used to know Tulisa,
I dont know about fazer but I been banned from avida
I do my laundry in public, I tell the bus where to stuff it,
I can pull my own strings, go shove your dick up a Muppet.
The only time you ain't no hood is when youre wearing a jumper
Every man you see around me, been around me since we where younger
There the only ones who will call me when I didn't had nudda
so its only right I made there balance look like a phone number
Im the type to sacrifice getting richer, just to help a brother
And if I could Id kidnap every undercover
I still smoke cheese, get in beef, try me, Im a burger
fuck a rapper sent for me, Ill get the burner.
Cuz they dont know a thing about me,
They dont know a thing about me,
They dont know a thing about me,
cause they dont know a, they dont know a.
They dont know a thing about me,
None of the words you hear about me
They dont know a, they dont know a
The ones who know you the least, are always the first to judge ya
But they dont know a thing about me(They don't know a thing)
Despite what they say at the end of the day,
what you expect? Were only human
Can't exactly stop them from assuming
Its time they learn a thing about me,
So heres the truth, this albums full of fire, fire.
Now, thats just my intro."

Oh oh oh oh oh oh hear me out
This is my King's Speech, I'm nowhere near the end
If I s-s-s-stutter, sorry I ain't heaven's sent
I messed my life up and yeah I've been down
I'm a changed man now, Chris Brown
You know I feel your pain 'cause I've done and been through it
I'm Kurt Cobain but I just couldn't do it
No point in turning back just to hit rewind
Back to the future, Ma Marty McFly
Deep inside, there's a fire
'Cause I'm no longer looking at a reflection I admire
I paint the picture of a fighter, but their's someone's looking back at me and says I'm a liar
If I should die before I wake, the least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith
[Chorus]
'Cause when I look in the mirror
I don't even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else
No regrets
No regrets
No point in crying over yesterday
No regrets
No regrets
'Cause we ain't even seen the best of days
Oh oh oh oh oh oh na na na na na
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
This is my last chance, I'm on my final straw
I came so close to b-b-b-breaking like a spinal chord
I came from nothing, some kid in Camden
Now I'm flying in the birds, Richard Branson
I'm a prince, yes I will get the crown (Shh)
Kate stays in my dungeon when her sister's around
So please forgive if I make mistakes
But I'll blow the bloody doors off, Michael Cain
If I should die before I wake, the least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith
[Chorus]
I'm free to be whatever I, 'cause I'm famous
Call me Gallagher 'cause I'm so shameless
The papers, saw the pages that are the cost of my failures
Victimized by the public, don't know if I could take it
So I sing
So when you feel like there's no more and nothing left but the life you've broken
No regrets, no turning back
Pick up yourself and tell them I'm just being me
[Chorus]
No regrets!
[Chorus]
'Cause when I look in the mirror (in the mirror)
I don't even recognize myself (oh oh oh oh)
Got the heart of a winner (of a winner)
But looking back at me is someone else (no)
No regrets (no)
No regrets
No point in crying over yesterday (ehhh)
No regrets
No regrets
'Cause you ain't even seen the best of me"

See, I never had anything, now I want it all.
All or nothing,
See, I would do anything just to have everything.
Look into my eyes and you will see the sun
Cause too much just aint enough.
So well turn to gold, cause we are on our own.
Im preparing, preparing, preparing to own it all,
I want it all, nothing in this worlds impossible,
See, I never had anything, so now I just want it all.
I want it all, and something deep inside makes me want more,
See, I would do anything just to have everything.
All or nothing,
See, I never had anything, now I just want it all.
All or nothing,
See, I would do anything just to have everything."

So I hate when I talk to my boy from pen and he acts like cuz you forgotten me!
I aint got time to sh*t let alone come check you blud

Right now Im in Europe fu*king up sh*t

So when you land you know I got you properly
(Chorus)
I bring my people through it, everything I

You reckon me I pop wid you
Ahhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa

For you
Aaaahhaa

For you
(Verse 2)
Yo, f*ck so good make a b*tch wanna find me
Wanna rolex ring Wiley
When I was a bum, no-one really liked me
Now its time someone went a got a new job for Tinie
Im only playing
Im just saying Ill sh*t so hard Im constipated
Overworked, underrated
Now my tings poppin off, no gun relation
Grind all day but I aint roller blading
All eyes on MOI, harder baby
No love for the ex, on night no tea towel
Tell Kelly ive got that motivation
I beg, someone find Max online and let her know I wanna smash her from the back
Sarah Jane come give me brain and put them big red lips on my sack!
Ill be killin cause Ill be getting bred
Hard doe, number 1s all day on the chart show
So F*CK YOU and your 90 track mixtape
Thats a million bars of arsehole
My flows are wrecked and it opens legs
Its fly than a motherf*cking jumbo jet
What a selfish b*stard, no respect
You know dapz, no regrets
I still roll through my hood and I wear my chain
F*ck a top boy Scorcher and Bashy cant do the same
Real recognised, reaaaalll
How many albums have you sold today?
I aint saying nuttin way not Kanye
But Im living life on the runway
If your nice, Ill be like Welcome on board my brudda, say bye to gun play
King of the jungle, hardest can be, I dare you to let your chick party with me
Im Tarzan and im hung like a tree
Imagine if your new born pops out looking exactly like moi
Banter, but on the real get her on pampers because Ill be on the tour bus getting pampered
I heard Simon Cowell thinks Im a little w*nker
An im getting on his tits like cancer
And I dont wanna start mentioning names
Where they all now? There bankrupt!
Joe McElderry, oh what a stand up!
Alexandra, pull your socks up!
Where you hits at? You aint no winner!
I feel bad cause your voice is amazing but your careers getting raped by a mason
That sh*t f*cking upsets me, cause it dont get me, try bring them near me
Coming round with your hand out, wanting a hand out, ahhhh thats too political
I dont care about a bentley, gucci or a fendi, mans living in a spaceship!
You got clapped by a, BANG! Your girl got mad by a BANG! That smooth criminal
Im a product of my environment I aint sayin me and you are any different
Im just planning an early retirement
I dont mean sorry when I say Im going Kingston
Every mans welcome to fly long distance
We be on the beach with Weed Man Winston!
Plus Im the craziest ting out the United Kingdom
(Chorus)
I bring my people through it, everything I
do
You reckon me I pop wid you
Ahhhhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaa
You a snitchin little bitch and you love
singin to the blues

Follow me, they let me out the hard door
I hear gossip cause i'm in the heat
Anyting that im packin needs its own passport

So is that your girl, she's high still
Somebody is coming home with me tonight

Got a table full of great goose and dont please

Have I thrown it all away

Why you staring at window when I'm the one with the pain
You know you set me off the rails

But Ive never been a doormat, thats the way mum raised me
Katie, Tracy they knew they couldnt keep me
So they tried to keep my baby
See them two are crazy
Alesha was feisty
So I found me the best of both worlds, thats a lighty
This mutha excites me
The b-tch turned Jet Li when she fights me
My yin and yang wifey
My certified rider, thats why I provide her
She says I only love her properly when Im inside her

Im a king, my sex is on fire
So hush baby girl, be quiet
Youre cool

Would you steal, would you run
Are you down if you are
We can ride through the avalanche

Look I got an ego way bigger than your average man
Why should I make the effort
If she dont understand
Yea I made the cheddar but she wants parmesan
Talk trash
Cut the crap I aint a garbage man
Cause anything I say find a way to turn the tables
I aint saying Im a sinner or any type of angel
Im just saying youll regret it youre ever unfaithful
Its just you and me G so I beg you just be grateful
Cause anywhere I go you know you got an invitation
I wanna see you there at my final destination
And you dont need a job cause I could be your occupation
But you f-ck around Ill sack your ass without a resignation

Put it, put it down on me baby do it nice and slow
If you ain't like them others show me something that I don't know
If you're a time bomb then I'm gonna make you blow

There ain't another like your kind
All eyes on the prize but you're mine
Never give up on something you can't go a day
Without thinking about
Just carry the light
From the fire
I can see it burning in your eyes
Do or die
We're crossing the line
There's no where left to hide
Tell me what you're waiting for
What you're living for
We're bringing it home
Oh oh ohhh
No one's left behind
You're not alone
'Cause we are , we are,
We are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home
'Cause we are , we are,
We are, we are the only ones
That can bring it, bring it home"

But you know I wouldn't be here
If it wasn't for you, you see I've tried this on my own,
I owe you, imagine if I never got to see you again.
I'm gonna bite my tongue next time that you're speaking,
'cause you deserve the time a day.
I abused your kindness with my weakness and threw it in your face.
Way to go, way to go, what a joke, I'm a joke,
If only you could see how I feel.
You bite your tongue next time that I'm screaming,
See, I ain't angry with you.
There's no escaping what I've done,
I hope you hear these words,
Lord, strike me down if any one of them's untrue.
You are the reason I am what I've become, I owe you.
Even though you don't want nothing, I owe you one.
Hand on heart, I don't think there's any other way to say this.
I admit being a prick didn't do me any favors,
I mean, I've been called every name under the sun's in my eyes,
But it feels pitch black inside,
I swear I put you through so much, now I couldn't lie to you if I tried
I admit acting a fool didn't do me any favors,

I'm so sorry if I've drained you out.
That's why I love you,

That I'm nothing without you
Just tell me, imma see you again?

So i hate when i talk to my boy from pen
And he acts like 'cuz you've forgotten me'
I ain't got time to shit
Let alone come check you blud
You know I'm hot property

Right now i'm in Europe
Fucking up shit more than the economy
So when you land, you know i got you properly
I bring my people through with everything i do
You repping me i fuck with you, ahh
You a snitching little bitch
And you love singing to the blues
Well this song wasn't made for you, ahh, ahh
I'm coming, i'm coming for you
Ahh, ahh
I'm coming, i'm coming for you
Yo, fuck so good make a bitch wanna fight me
Wanna rolex, ring Wiley
When i was a bum, no one really liked me
Now it's time someone went and got a new job for Tinie
I'm only playing, i'm just saying
I'ma shit so hard i'm constipated
Over-worked, underrated
Now my tings popping off
No gun relation
Grind all day but i ain't rollerblading
All eyes on moi, holla baby
No love for the X
On that note T tell Kelly i got that motivation
Look i beg, someone try and find Max online
Let her know i wanna smash her from the back
If not, Sarah Jane can come give me brain
And put them big red lips on my sack
I've been killing it cos i've been getting bread
Hard dough, number ones all day on the chart show
So fuck you and your 90 track mix-tape
That's a million bars of arseholes
My flows erected it opens legs
It's flyer than a mother-fucking jumbo jet
What a selfish bastard, no respect
You know daps, no regrets
I still roll for my hood and i wear my chain
Fuck a top boy Scorcher and Bashy can't do the same
Real recognise real
How many albums have you sold to date
I ain't saying that i'm Wayne or Kanye
But i'm living life on the runway
If you're nine, i'll be like, 'Welcome on board my brudda'
Say bye to the gun-play
King of the jungle, hard as can be
I dare you to let your chick party with me
I'm tarzan and i'm hung like a tree
Imagine if you knew Byron paps out
Looking exactly like moi
Batter not ahh, but on the real tele getting real pampers
Cos i'll be on the tour bus getting pampered
I heard Simon Cowell thinks i'm a little wanker
And now i'm getting on his tits like cancer
And i don't wanna start mentioning names
Fuck it, where they all now, they're bankrupt
Joe McElderry ahh, what a stand-up
Alexandra, pull your socks up
Where your hits at, you ain't no winner
I feel bad cos your voice is amazing
But your career's getting raped by a mason
That shit fucking upsets me
Cos they don't get me
Try bring them near me
Coming round with their hands out
Wanting a hand out
Ahh that's too political
I don't care about a Bently, Gucci or Fendi
Man's living in a spaceship
You got clapped by
Your girl got manked by
That smooth criminal
I'm a product of my environment
I ain't saying me and you are any different
I'm just planning a early return
Man i don't mean sorry when i say i'm going kingston
And every man's welcome to fly a long distance
We be on the beach with weed man Winston, Winston
Pssh, i'm the craziest ting out the United Kingdom
I bring my people through with everything i do

Back to the future, Ma Marty McFly
Deep inside, there's a fire
'Cause I'm no longer looking at a reflection I admire
I paint the picture of a fighter, but their's someone's looking back at me and says I'm a liar
If I should die before I wake, the least that I could ever say
I made mistakes but held on to my faith

'Cause when I look in the mirror
I don't even recognize myself
Got the heart of a winner
But looking back at me is someone else

So please forgive if I make mistakes

I made mistakes but held on to my faith

I'm free to be whatever I, 'cause I'm famous
Call me Gallagher 'cause I'm so shameless
The papers, saw the pages that are the cost of my failures
Victimized by the public, don't know if I could take it
So I sing
So when you feel like there's no more and nothing left but the life you've broken
No regrets, no turning back
Pick up yourself and tell them I'm just being me

No regrets!

You look me up and down as you flick your weave
Rude girl body like the magazine
Bum looking ripe
Like it dropped from the apple tree
I was told I should never hit a lady
But I've never been a doormat
That's the way mum raised me
Katie, Tracy they knew
They couldn't keep me
So they tried to keep my baby
See them two are crazy
Alesha was feisty
So I found me the best of both worlds, that's a lighty
This mutha excites me
The bitch turned Jet Li when she fights me
My yin and yang wifey
My certified rider, that's why I provide her
She says I only love her properly when I'm inside her
Damn right
I'm a king my sex is on fire
So hush baby girl, be quiet
You're cool
You're nice, you're nice
Living in a fantasy life
Kaching!

Ask her, who's shoes would you prefer
Oh boy real life, real talk
Calm down I can hear them Jimmy Choo's when you walk
You're black, you're white, best of both types my yin and yang wife
I'm looking for miss ride or die
I'd have a baby and I'll never leave one by my side
Someone who's loving me for life
I need an attitude girl who can handle my ting right
So you say your the one
You the one, you the one
But if my life was in danger you steal, would you run
Are you down if you are
We can ride through the avalanche
She blew my mind out this world like an avatar
Look I got an ego bigger than your average man
Why should I make the effort
If she don't understand
Yea I made the cheddar but she wants Parmesan
Talk trash
Cut the crap I ain't a garbage man
Cause anything I say find a way to turn the tables
I ain't saying I'm a sinner or any type of angel
I'm just saying you'll regret it you're ever unfaithful
It's just you and me G so I beg you just be grateful
Cause anywhere I go you know you got an invitation
I wanna see you there at my final destination
And you don't need a job cause I could be your occupation
But you f-ck around I'll sack your ass without a resignation
You're nice, you're nice
Living in a fantasy life

I'd have a baby and I'll never leave one by my side
Someone who's loving me for life
I need an attitude girl who can handle my ting right
How do I slow this down
When I'm already in so deep
And the position that you're in's just right
Ooh oh oh oh oh
Show me you can practice what you preach
Hurry up back it up back it up and you'll be gone
You're nice, you're nice

Yeah, my heart will save us cause I am never giving up on us
So if you love me, you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes
'Cause if you need me, you should have never pushed me away
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you never see
'Cause I see, you're beautiful to me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
They say that I'm a liar cause I'm from an estate
But what you say behind my back you know I'll say it to your face
I wish we could let bigons be bigons and so on and fire on
For you I swear I'll catch another case (hey)
So if you love me, you shouldn't care if I've made mistakes
And if you need me, you should have never pushed me away (hey, hey)
It's like you've been waiting on a different me (it's like you been waiting)
You say it could get better but you never see (you never see)
'Cause I see, you're beautiful to me ('cause I)
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it (when it comes down)
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
I weren't brought up round money so I didn't know how to treat it
I helped everyone round me and spent it all just when I needed it
I made a mil' and splashed it, did it all again
This time round, can't even trust myself, let alone my friends
If I'm the man why they don't play me no more?
That can't be fair right?
Just don't get it cause I'm on their side
I wish they wore these Nikes, took a hike
To see what it's like, in my spare time
And then come back and tell me that I deserve to lose all my air time
So don't be waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you never see
'Cause I see, you're beautiful to me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
It's like you've been waiting on a different me
You say it could get better but you never see
'Cause I see, you're beautiful to me
So when it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya
When it comes down to it
I'll always have love for ya, love for ya"

When I go in so deep the bitch can't speak
'Cause I'm a centaur compared to her last man
You know me, I keep it three hundred

Easy come, easy go so when it's all gone to me it just won't mean nothing

With an acoustic guitar and a rhyming Thesaurus
And I found an angle that no one had thought of
The story wrapped in an undeniable chorus
And everyone fell in love with that song
It must be the way that the melody
Marries the lyrics, someone should hear this
Cut one is the song
I booked a few gigs at every regional bar
And sold thousands of copies from the trunk of my car
An underground journalist said it was hot
And it could really take off, if track 2 got a shot
He wrote I fell in love with that song
It must be the way that the melody
Marries the lyrics, someone should hear this
Cut two is the song
I landed a deal, they loved my CD
A&R; was excited about track number 3
But said the snare was too loud, guitar too distorted
Lets get a big named producer and just re-record it
'Cause we all believe that is the song
It must be the way that the melody
Marries the lyric, the public should hear it
Cut 3 is the song
The producer had never heard demos this great
And there was just something special about 5, 6 and 8
The record execs said the research was in
They had made up their mind, theyre now goin' with track 10
'Cause everyone fell in love with that song
We couldnt believe they were serious
They had to be jokin, no the public had spoken
Cut 10 is the one
So the marketing geniuses, developed a plan
To spend lots of money and package the band
Hit the road in a bus, the show started to gel
But we couldnt recoup with no records to sell
But the fans fell in love with the songs
They said where can we find the CD?
We just downloaded 3
Free on Kazaa
And radio said
If a song had potential then
Cut 4 surely had it
But nobody had the balls to add it
So the record came out and it sat on the shelf
There was no need to talk about songs 9 through 12
After the whole thing was over and done
The public still talked about song number 1
Everyone fell in love with that song
It must be the way that the melody
Marries the lyrics but no one would hear it
They all fell in love with that song
Yeah, I may have written
The greatest most passionate song
No ones ever heard
We should have just covered 'Freebird'"

Take this advice. You're out of your head
Said: ""Stop, hold the phone, this has to be
Cut to the bone. Too bad I see red

He always lands on his feet

To turn the stone

You take your handbag and your coat
You don't want too much to carry
To slow you down on the way
You picture his face
In the morning
As he was going to work
Without saying a word
You saw the face
Of a stranger
It wasn't always like this before
His face like a stranger
You didn't know what to say
So you are going away
>From the face of a stranger
And not the lover you knew before
Why should you want to call your friends
Why should you want to start again
You tried explaining through the years
But it would always end in tears
And one thing you know for certain
You've said goodbye to that place
But still
You picture his face
In the morning
As he was going to work
Without saying a word
You saw the face
Of a stranger
It wasn't always like this before
His face like a stranger
You didn't know what to say
So you are going away
>From the face of a stranger
And not the lover you knew before
Somewhere a telephone
Is ringing in an empty room
Miles away
You are looking at a new town
But you are thinking of the past
The rain is falling down
Why do you keep that photograph
Of his face like a stranger
As he was going to work

As you enter

He squeezes
Then lets go your hand
Comfort me, comfort me
He sat out of the lamplight
As if to hide
While waiting for who
I'll never know
He smokes like he means it
To fill what he feels
That's empty
And nowhere to go
He sighs as he
Breathes me ""hello""
Comfort me
He looks right through me
To another face
A smile in his eyes
From another time and place
To feel what it was
That happened then
But he couldn't take me there
The streets seem familiar
But something's gone
I watch as he slumbers
To go in search
Of the picture
That fills what he feels
I break into the once long ago
He smiles as he
Breathes her ""hello""

And you'd laugh and laugh 'till I cried and cried

We drift apart
I can feel it in my heart
That man is not the man I used to know
And though a part of me still needs him so
There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly
No angry words and no heart-rending scenes
And we should take it as a warning
We keep on going through the old routines
Exchanging kisses in the morning
And with every day we drift apart
And the fear is in my heart
I read the signs and I should be mature
And yet a child could not be more unsure
There's something wrong
And I feel my love die
Slowly, slowly
Our passion's just a distant memory
And in its place a dull frustration
A cold indifference where there used to be
At least a frequent irritation
But a feeling still
Of tenderness
And of pity, so I guess
I'll be the woman in his arms tonight
If he should need someone to hold him tight
He's like a child
But I feel my love die

If ever you were nervous about it
You gotta know,
I ain't never,
Lemme say that again,
I ain't never, goin' nowhere
Listen to me
Last night I almost cried when you told me
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gonna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that I've got for you
I'm telling you
When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin' nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I ain't never goin' nowhere
I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
until I found you and you made it
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you don't know the half of it
But baby here's the rest of it
Did you know that your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and I'm the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby that's for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this
When I'm out in the club at night
You don't have to worry about a thing
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that I'm gon be 'with for the rest of my life
And I ain't goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You don't have to worry no more
'cause I ain't goin' nowhere

You don't have to worry about a thing

What did I do, tell me what the problem is
I don't want to see, want to see you leave
Want to let you go, I just want to find a way to work it out
We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
I apologized tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think its time to let this go

And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us want to be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go
Girl it's hard for me to tell you that it's over
I hate feeling this way
But I know you know things just haven't been the same
We always said that we, we would tell the truth
No matter what it is, can't continue to pretend our heart is in it
I'm waiting for you to see, the reality
We at dead end, there no way to go unless we gonna to be just friends
I love you so much, never thought that I would ever have to say
That I think its time to let this go

Oh girl
What happened to the love
What happen to the girl
The girl I fell in love with
I never thought I'd been the one to say goodbye

Without the root, you ain't got no tree
And without the branches, you ain't got no leaves
To understand her is to understand me
Cause that's how close we are
Without a sea, you ain't got no air
And it ain't no walking if you ain't got the legs
Understand I use them eyes to see
That's how close we are
Heart to heart
Breath to Breath
She fills me up till there ain't none left
No space, no time
Her sprits my mind
You see that's how close we are
That's how close we are (X2)
Without the stars, there's no galaxy
And without the river, you don't have no sea
Just look at my life, and it's her you'll see
Cause that's how close we are
And without a voice no one could hear you sing
And it ain't flying without the wings
So when you see me flying
It's her carrying me
That's how close we are
Chorus
She talks with me
She walks with me
She's holding me
And yes, She's teaching me
Everything I can't do
Everything I can't say
She does for m
She prays with me
She cries with me
She's loving me
Nothing could compare to the love we share
So that woman and man
Who understands you can say:

Cause nowadays you got a new attitude
And you barely answer my calls and when I finally get through
You rush of the line like I don't matter to you
Was it something I said, girl what did I do
If there's a problem it ain't hard for us to work it out
There's no difference from what we've been through before
I can't move on and I won't until we make it better

But just because a playa steady ballin' people steady talkin'
He say she say get you?
I saw yo' girl talkin'
But to 112 and Twista walkin' to the truck bout to get?

All the bitches be in big ballin' confusion
Niggas trippin' off the ladies they be losin'
Pardon my intrusion
That chick about to have you cruisin' for a bruisin'
Cause there's rules in this game
Playa don't check the pimp, go and check yo' hoe
Give her that good third in a flip flop colored Excursion
For a hit of that blow
Don't try to calm lil' momma down, you know them freak bitches be
Don't get done in like Pretty Tone cause yo' kitty gone
Yo' chick just chose me
You ain't cut like? Tailors
You ain't one of them get higher than helium playas
Or three tone? Gators
You can't never spit fire on no CD and fade us
Lame, greedy instigators
Can't see how you mad just cause she date me

This is the real right here
Things ain't always what
They seem check it
People look at us
And say man they got it made
They signed a record deal
And now them boys is paid
But they don't know what
Comes along with it
With all the fame and the
Fortune there's still bull
Cause even though we struggled hard
And gave up everything
Just to make it this far
Some people love us, and
Other people hate us
But we gonna take the haters
Make them our motivators
Cause they don't
Know what we've been through
And none of them could ever
Walk a mile in our shoes
And I got to keep it real
Every record deal ain't a good
Record deal, but I'm a grown man
So I didn't cry about it
Kept my head up, stayed strong
Until I got up out that contract
And I reminisce on what my lawyer
Use to say, but I wanted it so bad
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Everyday, ya
Everyday the pressures of
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing

This game got us goin insane

What's goin on with one twelve
If they leave, if they leave
Are their records gonna sell
They say that he gave us the hits
Knowin' damn well that we write our own sh
It's not that I'm mad about it
But I gotta clear it up
For those wonderin about it
I think you need to read the credits
Open up the CD dog and read the credits
Cause things ain't always what they seem
So don't believe everything you see on TV
In the videos, I was in a Bentley
And that Bentley in it, belonged to me
My earrings had to be at least five carrots
I had to live up to that superstar status
Stayed on the road had to stay
Doing shows even though I'm going broke
I couldn't let nobody know
Everyday the pressures of
This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing

This game got us goin insane
If it ain't one damn thing it's
Another thing it's another thing
People look at us and say
How does it feel on a new label
With a multi million dollar deal?
I'm just glad we stayed together
We put our faith in the lord
And he made things better
Cause he said it in his word
That one day your gonna get
What y'all deserve, wow
Now aren't ya glad we stayed together
Through the good and the bad times
We stayed together
Through the rich and the broke times
Through stormy weather
And hey, now we look back like
Don't you remember
When you couldn't afford that boy
Hey, sunroof top
Chillin' on the scene
With a down south female
Like hey, how ya love that
Twenty four inch rims
Big body Cadillac
And hey, we do it like that

I know I do,
What about you,
I just can't get enough of the time
I need you in my life,
Where do we go,

I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,
Girl I want to be with you,
No one else,
Only you,
Why can't we just,
Make it happen,
Baby, I need you in my life
Every time I'm with you,
Never want it to come to an end (thought I told you that we won't stop),
You always make me so happy,
You'll always have a place in my heart
I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,
Where do I go,
What must I do,
If I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby,
Like I am the only one for you,

Outside I see the rain is falling
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow?
Set this place on fire
'Cause I'm tired of your lie
All I needed was a simple ""Hello""
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
(And you) You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out, over you
Cryin' over you, yeah
Never wanted to see things your way
Had to go astray
For why was I such a fool (why was I such a fool)
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Romance of the flames
Why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected (So sorry baby)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected
(I) I gave you all of me (Gave you all of me)
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
(I) I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out (All cried out)
Over you
(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain

Knowing that no one's there
Something is telling me
That you feel the way I do
I dream of you all the time
Wishing that you were mine
I'm feeling so empty
Hoping you'll think of me
I need ya here tonight
[Chorus]
If I'm all alone
And you're all alone
Ain't nothing wrong
Having someone to hold
Oh, your tender touch
It means so much
It feels so right having someone to hold
It's very plain to see
I want you next to me
Give me your hand and
I'll try to understand
Girl I love you so
I can't let you go
Ain't nothing wrong with having someone to hold
Every now and then
I get to wondering
Are you with someone else
Or could you be by yourself
I turn on the TV
It's a picture of you and me
And I'm going crazy
Cause I miss my baby
I want you here tonight, tonight
[Chorus]
Baby, I love you so
And everything that you have done for me
No one has ever done before
And I'll never let you go
You mean the world to me
And baby the way you make me feel
Whenever I'm alone with you
Is irreplaceable

He said that you were losin your mind
And that you don't know how to treat a man
But baby you do me just fine
Everytime he comes around
He tells me how you did him wrong
Telling me you broke his heart
But I don't really give a damn about what he says
Cause check this out

I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think (I think) that you deserve a good man
I think (I think) that I could be the man for ya
So baby won't you take my hand
I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think that you deserve a good man
I think that I could be the man for ya
So baby (baby) won't you take my hand
He says your disrespectful
And that you don't know how to carry yourself
And now he's tellin me your ghetto
But still I want no one else
I'm really sick and tired of him
And the way that he talks about you
I think I'm gonna tell him (oh yea oh yea) hey i love that woman

He's always telling me that you're not the one for me
But I see things in you that he would never see
So no matter what he says and baby no matter what he might do
There is nothing and no one that can change my feelings for you oh baby yea

I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere
Z too hot to stop
So we goin' from the bedroom to the floor
Let you know a nigga miss you when out on tour
When our tongues touch
Have a playboy sing it much
Roll a Dutch, let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you
What kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I bump hard till you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true player's what I seem to you
And if you want it
We can do it in the Black 500
Wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride cause I'm hot now
You got me goin', I don't think I wanna stop now
Z feinin' like a criminal on lockdown
So let's get a way to get away
You gettin' hot baby, please don't melt away
I got a crib on the beach in Palmetto-way
And here's your personal key to see me everyday
112
We can make love in the bedroom
Floatin' on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere
We can make love in the bedroom floor
Floatin' on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere"

I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
(I can't believe you've gone away)
Hours, days and nights I sat and I prayed
Never thought that I would see this day
I didn't think that it could hurt so bad
A broken heart was never meant for me
Lord, let it please rain on my face
So that it could wash away all my tears
If this is the house that love is in let me leave
'cause I don't want to be hurt like this again
I can't believe
[Chorus]
Many times I watched you while you were asleep
With thoughts of living life with only you
If I had read your mind and things could have changed
I'll give anything to be with you again
All I ever wanted was to see your face
And hear your pretty voice from day to day
Now that you've gone I have no reason for feeling that way
I can't believe you've gone away
[Chorus]
When I look back on the times we've shared
Our life was ok, now what else could come down
Don't you know you were my love (my only love)
And I can't believe that you've gone away

Leaving you was the worst,

You tell me that I'm the only one

I never wanna see your face again
I don't even wanna be your friend
Don't wanna be used by you again
So I'm saying goodbye
Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known
Listen baby
Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Alright
I never shoulda put my trust in you
But I never thought you'd let me down
It seems like you get a thrill out of
Out of making me cry
And baby everybody's seen it but me
Cuz I was so blind I couldn't see
I never really needed your help
I could do for myself

I'm just playing with your head

I want it for you more
Than you want it for yourself
Always there for you
I was there for you, there for you
What ever you needed
You know what I've gone through for you
I was saying bye-bye baby
Now whatcha gonna do
My love is gone, the money gone and the house too
Now how bout you?
Get away from me and let me clear my mind
This is hurtin' me just to visit you one more time
I know you fine but I ain't gonna get distracted by your charm
I figure this is the beginning, you intended some harm
Remain calm, it ain't no reason to drop the ball
you should get 10 points just for being On My Arm
But still, that's the past tense, I was speakin' a then
You asking me 'bout that woman now, it's a negative ten""
I had to catch myself before I tried to make her my girl
Start a family and start to bring kids in this world
See life is like a gun, it can backfire then shoot you.
What's good for the present ain't always good for the future
I shake and shiver, look deeply in the mirrow at myself
Wondering will I make it with someone else
Whatcha gonna do
Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you

When we're together, can't you see it's destiny
When I'm near you it feels like you're a part of me
And baby I don't want you to go away from me, no
Let me show you
Can I get to know you
Baby let me give you
All my love
Let me show you
Can I get to know you

And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you

Wondering where we went wrong
'Cause now I'm here all alone
Wishing you'd come back home, so tell me

Why, why, why did you have to go away
Got me missing you every day
Baby tell me why
Why, why did you have to go away
Got me missing you every day
Every day I'm missing you
I don't understand why you left
Baby what didn't I do
Wasn't I always there for you
And wasn't I good to you
How was I to know something was wrong
Baby, I can't read minds
All you had to do was tell me
But you kept it all inside
Girl I'll never find another
Another one to take your place
'Cause you were so, so good to me baby
And you kept the smile upon my face
And I'm on my bended knee and I'm crying
Won't you come back to me
To me, 'cause you mean the world to me
Why, why, why did you have to go away
Got me missing you every day
Oh tell me why
Why, why did you have to go away
Got me missing you every day
I'm missing you

Why, why go away every day
I'm missing you
Why, why go away every day"

Oh Babe
Ah Darlin
Oh Babe
My My Sweet Babe
[Repeat 2X]
[Verse 1]
A man is important
In a scheme of things
He's the King of his castle
And the head of his household
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a leader
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in

Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman

And tell me who wears the pants around here

She's the corner stone of this family
She's the mother of the earth

Luda yea what you heard is true
I'll make you do things you ain't even know you can do
Got them weak in the knees 'cause my back is strong
And you wonder why your girls want to tag along
'Cause them birds are jealous
My words are embellish
Plus they heard I kiss every curve and crevice
I'm too hot to handle
I rock your mantle
When I play 112 and light 16 candles
Deep sea fishing in your favorite position
Everytime you moan I pay close attention
Flip 'em like a pancake
Show me something
Or we can bring in your vibrating tongue ring
Lets mountain climb 'til we reach the peak
The technique will make you sweat
But don't sweat the technique

Left there for me to find.
All the words were on that page.
All my dreams came true that day

It said you loved me but you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way.
It said you only wished someday that I would feel the same.
In your letter,
Your letter.
I guess it just never occurred to me
That you would feel the way I do.
You kept the sweetest secret from my heart.
You kept those feelings in
No you never showed a sign.

Inside your letter.

To think that you could think of me that way.
It's like it's led my sweetest dream,
And may that dream come true,
I would be with you
Always
I saw a name I didn't recognize.
I felt the tears gone to my eyes.
Seeing that the love that you've been longing for,
Was another love not mine.
No you never showed a sign,

And when it was there for you, because now you're coming back to me and you recognize the love that was once there, but now I found somebody else, and it's too late. I'm sorry.
You should've known that I loved you
You should've seen it in my eyes
Should've allowed yourself to believe in love and recognize
That my love it wasn't going nowhere
No one but you was in my heart
And I can't believe that you would push true love aside
[Chorus]
Baby
It's too late
You missed out on me
And I'm so sad
Sad that you're gone away
I'm sorry you missed out on me
But it's too late
You let love slip away
And you should have known that I was open
You should've seen it in my smile
Should've allowed yourself to be an adult instead of a child
But you were the one with insecurities
So don't try and put the blame on me
You never knew that my love was really here to stay

Baby tell me how you let our love fade away
When you knew I cared for you
And baby I loved you
And you never gave me your everything
This love that was meant for you

Then with you
Please let me do you again

Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
You touch me there, what are you thinkin', ooh
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
Here comes the sun, now what are you thinkin', ooh
Lying here on a bed full of trust
Just don't fully cover the lust
Anticipating on the questions I'll ask
Was I strong enough or will I last, I don't know
It's kinda hard to play this right
These feelings that I have inside
Is something that I just can't, can't hide

Can't believe how this feels

Emotionally drained
Don't remember every name
Of every person that I meet
We're all so hard to please
Expectations so heavy
And the television makes me sad
Now we suffer through everything
We try to please everyone
Its not easy to do
Now we suffer through everything
We try to please everyone
Its not easy to do
And now I try to be your best friend
Id die to be your best friend
But its all up to you"

If I have to be patient
Let it be so
Cause if I have to wait

the direction of your love

my heart is aching
its aching all the time
my heart knows what it wants
and it wants you to be mine
so give me a direction
of where I should go and
give me the direction of your love...

we will fight and we will bicker
but our love only grows thicker
and then we kiss because we know
that this is home
i'll be patient I will wait
pray to god that this is fate
but still i wont be satisfied until i know
that I wasn't patient all alone.
if i have to be silent
i guess that will be okay
il sit here and be compliant
if it means you will stay
so give me a direction
of where i should go
give me the direction of your love..
Chorus:
we will fight and we will bicker
but our love only grows thicker
and then we kiss because we know
that this is home
i'll be patient I will wait

that I wasn't patient all alone.
so give me a direction
of where I should look

of your never ending book
my mind it starts to wander
of all the places I can find her
but still I wont be satisfied until I know
that I wasn't patient all alone"

ho vissuto ancora poco
la tua esperienza infatti non cel'ho.
Arrivo un po' per caso
in un mondo dorato
a cui non ho voluto dire no.
La mia generazione
ha fame di occasioni
che questo tempo non gli da
muove le sue ali
cercando i suoi ideali
e la sua libertÃ 
Se una risposta non c'Ã¨
non voglio abbandonare la vita nelle mani del destino
io devo fidarmi di me
se rido a nuovi giorni da inventare
e se non smetto di sognare
Niente Ã¨ impossibile
Niente Ã¨ impossibile
Mostrami un futuro
che non sia solo fumo
qualcosa in cui mi posso riconoscere.
Dammi un'emozione
e scriverÃ² il tuo nome
se mi salvi dalla solitudine.
La mia generazione
paga l'illusione
che maschera questa realtÃ 
muove le sue ali
cercando i suoi ideali
e la sua veritÃ 
Se una risposta non c'Ã¨
non voglio abbandonare la vita nelle mani di nessuno
io devo fidarmi di me
inseguo nuovi spazi da esplorare
e non smetto di sognare

sorrido a nuovi giorni da inventare

You would even say it glows

Used to laugh and call him names
They wouldn't let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Santa came to say
""Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?""
Then how the reindeer loved him
As they shouted out with glee

You'll go down in history.""

I ran into a friend of mine while wandering down the street

I went (meanderin', meanderin'

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
Bring us home, Jason
It's cold outside
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart, right within your heart"

It's thrilling to do a dance that's new the parachute jump
When the music begins to rise
Then you begin to glide
Bouncing from side to side the parachute jump
You leap into space smile on your face
But what do you know down there below the world is in place
Hold it steady so you won't slip
Atta boy let her rip
Then you begin to dip, the parachute jump
You dance and when you dance the angels are singing songs from high on the blue
You dance so high a dance suddenly heavens doors are open to view
You sway and as you sway
All of your dreams it seems are coming true
You whirl into a spin
Loving the spin you're in when you do do do
Parachute jump, the parachute jump
You drop and drop and pop you stop and land with a bump
If you really would like to fly
Feel like a bird on high
Take my advice and try the parachute jump

tourists from the sticks
And those wise Greenwich guys really open up your eyes painting portraits of
their pretty little chicks

To the guys that draw their bunnies or the Sunday morning funnies

It was just a twig
Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
It wouldn't die
Came running in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart
I loved her so
I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve
Two years ago
It would sure embarrass her
When I came home from working late
'Cause I would know
That she'd been sitting there and crying
Over some sad and silly
Late, late show
And Honey, I miss you
I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could
She wrecked the car and she was sad
And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck
I came home unexpectedly
And found her crying needlessly
In the middle of the day
It was in the early spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And Honey, I miss you
And I'm being good
I'd love to be with you
If only I could
Yes, one day while I wasn't home
When she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories
Of Honey and I wake up nights
And call her name
Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
A small cloud passes overhead
And cries down in the flower bed
That Honey loved
See the tree, how big it's grown
But friend, it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big

On Mulberry Street, have you ever been there
Every street's a boulevard in Old New York
So keep smiling and you'll never wear a frown
Just remember there's an East Side
And the West Aide and Uptown and Down
That's why we're proud to be a part of New York Town
34th Street
Union Square
Mulberry Street
Have you ever been there
Every street's a boulevard in Old New York
Streets are paved with happiness in Old New York
We're glad that we're a part of it, we're happy that we came
Each sidewalk is a concrete path to fame"

I've grown accustomed to the tune
He whistles night and noon
His smiles, his frowns, his ups, his downs

Like breathing out and breathing in

Surely I could always be that way again and yet
I've grown accustomed to his looks, accustomed to his voice
Accustomed to his face
I've grown accustomed to his face
He almost makes the day begin
I've gotten used to hear him say
Good morning everyday
His joys, his woes, his highs, his lows
Are second nature to me now

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
A ploughin' through the ragged skies
And up a cloudy draw.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
The ghost herd in the sky.
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves was made of steel,
Their horns wuz black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders comin' hard
And he heard their mournful cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred and shirts all soaked
With sweat,
They're ridin' hard to catch that herd but they ain't caught them yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on, hear their cry.
Yippee-yi-ay, yippee-yi-o,
Ghost riders in the sky.
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name,
""If you want to save your soul from hell a-riding on our range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
A-try'ng to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies.""

But if it costs a dime to get around the world I couldn't get out of sight
But if I ever get back to Georgia there'll be no messing around
If I ever get back to Georgia I gonna nail my feet to the ground
(In the cold cold ground)
Well the buildings here in New York City grow so doggone tall
Sometimes you can walk for a couple of days and never see the sun at all
So I left last night I was homeward bound now I wanna sit and I cry
Cause I stuck out my thumb till my thumb got numb and the cars went right on by
But if I ever get back to Georgia...
(In the cold cold ground)
Well I guess my time in New York City hasn't been a total waste
Cause I met a little girl from a social world I really put her in her place
When she sold me half of the Brooklyn Bridge I hung around just for spite
And I played this part till I won her heart and I bought the other half last night
But if I ever get back to Georgia...
But if I ever get back to Georgia...

I suspected sorcery
Something magic in the air
But I knew it had to be reality or you were there
Once upon a time in love-land
We had a rendezvous
We went sailing on a moonbeam
As lovers do
It was a fantasy a fairytale a fancy flight
And then it all came true
Once upon a time last night

Why he gave the horse my money is something I don't know

Manana is good enough for me

My father said he only learned to be a silly fool
My father said that I should learn to make a chili pot
But then I burned the house down the chili was too hot
Manana Manana
Manana is soon enough for me
The window it is busted and the rain is coming in
If someone doesn't fix it I'll be soaking to my skin
But if we wait a day or two the rain may go away
And we don't need a window on such a lovely day
Manana manana manana is soon enough for me

Off the wall, that's all
By the time I make Oklahoma, she'll be sleeping

I see now that's all it meant to you
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle
Now I'm all alone just playing solitaire
In each romance there's an element of chance
The gamble to win or to lose
You play to win
Then you find you're playing in a game with no rules, just made for fools
Now the joker has the laugh on me
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly
And until you want to share that old feeling
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire

Were things they never taught me in a class room
Like where to find a handout
While thumbing through Chicago in the afternoon
Hey I'm not bragging or complaining
I'm just talking to myself man to man
This old lentil fat I'm chewing
Didn't take a lot of doing
But I take a lot of pride in what I am
I guess I grew up a loner
Don't remember ever having any folks around
But I keep thumbing through the phone books
And looking for my Daddy's name in every town
And I meet lots of people
But I always end up leaving on the lam
Hey where I've been, where I'm going
I didn't take a lot of knowing
But I take a lot of pride in what I am
I never travel in a hurry
'Cause I got nobody waiting for me anywhere
Home is anywhere I'm living
If it's sleeping on some vacant beach or city square
Or if I'm working on some road gang
Or just living off the fat of our great land
I never been nobody's idol but at least I have a title
And I take a lot of pride in what I am

You dropped your skis a happy circumstance
No one would have guessed we had started
Started a winter romance
And all the way to Maine
On that enchanted train
The passing scenery didn't get a glance
We held hands completely light hearted
Off to a winter romance
We danced that night by candle light
The world was white with snow
The way we felt we never felt
The snow could melt and go
But though the snow is gone the romance lingers on
And those that said it didn't stand a chance
Will know when they see us together
That love's not been controlled by the weather
And all of our summers we'll have our winter romance

Now some folks play the whole day long
They think they got it made
But they won't get a thrill the way that I live
When I find me a place in the shade
A poor man word is never learned still I wouldn't trade
All the world and its gold all the treasures untold
I want a little place in the shade
Too late to bed and early to rise
Makes a man weary and cuts him down the size
They come and they go and their worlds fall apart
But I'm gonna cling to the dreams in my heart
Cause someday I know the years gonna come
When all my debts are paid
When my work is all done I'll smile at the sun

Oh, you should run alike I
In the morning, black flag for the morning
Why'd you do this?
I thought that you know better,
We've been through this
You were (???) baby!
Well said baby, now tell me something new
You slay me with what you're saying, what you do
Don't try me, 'cause I'm not in the mood (please don't try)
In the morning, white flag, I surrender to you
Packed up baby, I got a ticket booked
But got a lot honey, I know you're, I know you're hooked on hurt
Baby, you like to keep it blue
In the morning black flag, I'll be mourning for you"

I can't see you
Hiding behind your charade
Was it hard to
See that I would
Carry your weight
When the road was too dark
To navigate, love
Heard me crying
In the bathroom
Leave and dreaming
Didn't you, oh didn't you know
All I needed was my best friend
To come back from wherever he go
Babe when we ran through the halls of hotels
And love that we made was a love hotter than hell
And your arms, my blanket at night
The touch of your lips was my paradise
All of this time I should have stuck up for myself
It's a crime, was so bad for my mental health
I remember you asking what did I expect
All I needed was a little of your respect
Babe there were times I felt lonely
Lying next to you at night, that wasn't right, no
Should have let go of your ego
Turned to see the girl you loved when we first met
Babe when we ran through the halls of hotels
And love that we made was a love hotter than hell
And your arms, my blanket at night
The touch of your lips was my paradise
All of this time I should have stuck up for myself
It's a crime, was so bad for my mental health
I remember you asking what did I expect
All I needed was a little of your respect
I was still there
Hiding somewhere
Me with my anxiety
Forgot to breathe
It was so hard
Just to let you know
You're up in your adrenaline
After the show
Babe it's a shame that the game went the way it did
I've loved you forever
Both you and your kid
-- the fifth floor if it ain't you old age
And after the last time that you leave the stage
Though I loved you for everything, all that you are
Though I've settled all the lonely you sustained
All -- so skin to skin
My best friend, lover, my company and I
Remember you asking what did I expect
All I needed was a little of your respect"

Longing for my befores and afters
All in all, it's been cool
And there's nothing I wouldn't do
I'm so happy being me
So happy being me, I'm regretting nothing 'bout me
Too busy living life, living love freely
So happy being me
Stop reaching back for your beginnings
All those broken dreams that went down stream
As we grow, live and know
Somethings were never meant to be
Just like people, they come and go
Some will live forever and some will never know
That's why God gives us memories
To lead us to our victories, I'm so happy loving me
So happy being me
I'm regretting nothing 'bout me
Too busy living life, living love freely
So happy being me
All though hidden treasures
Feel little a pleasure
We could never replace this love
We can't no, we can't no
The sunlight leads us to a place
And the moonlight keeps us in his grace

Blow for blow we fight back
Shout it out we are men

Just to make Mrs. Rich smell nice
Watch the many beggars roaming streets and doorways
Just a piece of bread, just a coin and for them a dream

It's a shame to have money and ignore the need
Closing your eyes makes your mind turn greedy
Want and need are the same for us all
Black or white, rich or poor

The mate was a mighty sailin' man,
the Skipper brave and sure,
five passengers set sail that day,
for a three hour tour,
a three hour tour.
The weather started getting rough,
the tiny ship was tossed.
If not for the courage of the fearless crew
the Minnow would be lost.
The Minnow would be lost.
The ship's aground on the shore of this
uncharted desert isle
with Gilligan,
the Skipper too.
The millionaire and his wife,
the movie star,
the professor and Mary Ann,
here on Gilligan's Isle.
(Ending verse)
So this is the tale of our castaways,
they're here for a long, long time.
They'll have to make the best of things,
it's an uphill climb.
The first mate and his Skipper too
will do their very best,
to make the others comfortable
in their tropic island nest.
No phone, no lights, no motor car
not a single luxury
like Robinson Crusoe,
it's primitive as can be.
So join us here each week my friends,
you're sure to get a smile,
from seven stranded castaways
here on Gilligan's Isle!"

They're full of smoke
And we're suffocating

That it was I; and nothing more

Yearbooks, letters, black and whites
A hundred, maybe more
Next thing I know my brothers and me
Got 'em scattered on the floor (yeah)
There was one of her, flippin' the bird
Sittin' on a Harley
And a few with some hairy hippie dude
Turns out his name was Charlie
Her hair, her clothes, her drinkin', smokin'
Had us boys confused
I'll never forget the day us nosy kids got introduced...
To mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
Won't admit she smoked marijuana
But I saw mama 'fore she was mama
We put that box right where it was
And never said a word
But growin' up got hard just tryin'
Not to picture her
In anything but aprons, dresses
Mini-vans and church
Oh, and Daddy would have whooped our butts
For diggin' up that dirt...
On mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
She won't admit she smoked marijuana
But I saw mama 'fore she was mama
We laugh and hang it over her head
Right above her halo
Her face turns red when we bring up
That tie-dyed Winnebago
She runs and hides and still denies
That hip-high rose tattoo
She burned that box of forget-me-nots
When she found out we knew...
About mama 'fore she was mama
In a string bikini, in Tijuana
Won't admit she smoked marijuana

And Heaven knows I always will
'Cause she loves me every single day and night
And she says we are everything that's good in her life
She says she loves me more than anything on earth
And that's almost as much as I love her
She likes to lay down on me
And rest her head on my chest
And softly whisper to me
What she won't share with anyone else
And there's a sweetness in her laughter
When it's just the two of us
And I try so hard to capture

Can we put a man on the moon

For a place like St. Jude's

In a place where all they know is war
And a guy like me,
Has always been free
How can two people
Who've built a loving home
Try for years
And never have a child of their own
When somewhere out there tonight
There's a baby no one's holding tight
In need of love
To me that don't add up
I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have
Why did my cousin
Have to die in that crash
A good kid only seventeen
I still wonder 'bout that
It seems unfair to me
Some get the chance to chase their dreams
And some don't
But what do I know
I wasn't there the day you filled up the oceans
I didn't get to see you hang the stars in the sky
So I don't mean to second guess you
Or criticize what I don't understand
These are just a few questions I have
Why do I feel like
You hear these prayers of mine
When so many ought to be
Ahead of me in line
When you look down on me
Can you see the good through all the bad

All decked out and made up for TV,
Askin' for some money from God's people:
Talking all that high theology.
Well, I might be just an old blue collar:
There's things about the Lord that I don't know.
But I bet he never had a million dollars,
Or wore a lot of stylish fancy clothes.
'Cause Jesus was a country boy,
Walkin' down a dirt road, with everything that he owned,
He never met a stranger.
Born in a barn underneath the stars,
His Mama laid him in a manger.
Swimmin' in the river, fishin' for his dinner,
Livin' with the sinners like me.
Makes me think, Jesus was a country boy.
My Daddy never cared much for religion,
And my Mama worried a lot about his soul.
She'd hit her knees and pray for him on Sunday,
While Daddy hit his favorite fishin' hole.
You see, Daddy was a rebel and a rambler,
But I always knew he loved my Mama so.
An' I never doubted he'd make it to Heaven,
'Cause it ain't who you are, it's who you know.
An' Daddy knew: that Jesus was a country boy,
Walkin' down a dirt road, with everything that he owned,
He never met a stranger.
Born in a barn underneath the stars,
His Mama laid him in a manger.

She grabbed her purse, took me by the hand and said come with me
We drove around until we found the three of them
I wondered who was blessing who when they got in
We bought them food and cloths and drove them to a toy story
And the little girl said I dont need a brand new doll
as she hugged the broken armless one they found before
she said this one needs me more
She aint pretty, but shes beautiful
She aint perfect, but shes wonderful
She might be broken, but shes loveable
She aint pretty, but Shes beautiful
Last night my wife and I talked till the sun came up
About how we fuss and fight sometimes,
Say ugly things act so unkind
But we think God we always find our way back to love
It aint pretty, but its beautiful
Our love aint perfect, but its wonderful
Were still learning to be loveable
It aint pretty, but its beautiful
Were all learning to be loveable
Aint always pretty, but its beautiful"

From the big city bankers to the plowboys
They love their ribeye, ropin' steers
Shootin' Jose Tequila, and long neck beers

Everybody wants love, love, love
Everybody wants love
Everybody needs love, love, love
Everybody needs love
Over in Nashville they love their country
Eatin' biscuits and gravy on Sunday
They love the opry, George Jones
Crankin' Sweet Home Alabama and The Rolling Stones
New York, New York big as it gets
They like to fight between the Yankee's and the Knicks
Down South they love their football

She's got a classic custom mustang
Black top love machine
Factory paint, liscense plate says '77 queen
Weavin' through the traffic
Like she ain't afraid to crash
Zepplin' on the A train
Thunder on the dash

Come Monday she's all business far as anyone can see
She walks the line, dots her I's, and crosses all her t's
Everybody thinks that she's too uptight to be true
When all along she's sittin' on that

Now it's stirrin' within

Down in the askes of a light that I let bury me
One hand pullin' me under, and another tryin' to set me free
In the struggle, I know I lost my way
Somehow I never lost my faith

Where do you hide when the bottom falls outta the sky

So, where do you go when it rains in Mexico

The little umbrella's a doin' the best that it can
Everybody said this is the place to set your spirit free
But, I came out, and the clouds came up and they poured down on me
So
I gotta wring out my shirt when I get back to the hut
I gotta find a place to dry off my coconut
There's a pretty little brown eyed girl flaggin' a taxi cab
She's alone, so she might know
Maybe I should ask
Hey, hey, hey

I supplied the rum

Well, it's alright, I'll be okay
I'll just wait for the clouds
Hit my knees, pray for rain
Just fall down
Maybe the moon won't be so bright
When it stairs into the sun
Never know I got even
When the morning comes
But I'll just deal with what I'm dealt
Cool wind in my hair
Standin' here waves crashin' in
And the clean smell of salt air

I don't want to know

And I cried as heaven took you on angel's wings
I woke up and screamed

Took my soul to the river and washed it clean
Feels so good, Lord, why can't there be
Seven Sundays a week?

It is well, it is well with my soul
And mama laid up the Sunday best

Til I walked in
I looked up, saw your face, turned around
And I walked back out again
Then I thought there's too much that we shared
So I made myself get ahold of myself
And walked back in
And went right up to you
I could feel you were caught off guard
Neither one of us knew just what to do
So I said
How ya been, been a while
Tell me how's your Mama
You said Good, you can sit down if you wanna
I said I was just thinkin' bout Oklahoma
The wild roller coaster ride we had that summer
Before we knew it we were on our 2nd glass of wine
Sittin' there talkin' just like
We had never said goodbye
Well even after all that time well it clicked just like before
Maybe a little more
Before we knew it they were closing up the joint
Yea, stackin' them chairs
Lockin' them doors
I asked the waitress would she mind if we slept there
And stayed for breakfast
We both laughed
You grabbed your purse
I paid our tab
Standing underneath the moon
I couldn't help but ask
What you say we take a stroll down by the river
What a night, girl can you believe this weather
I been thinking we were pretty damn good together
You said yea wonder why did we ever let it go
I said I don't know but after seeing you tonight
Well It feels just like
We had never said goodbye
Never said goodbye
I been thinking maybe we should give it one more try
Like we never said good bye"

But I spend all my time just ridin' around
Tryin' to shake this negative mood I'm in
I know where to go if I want to get down
All the usual suspects are hangin' around
But after a round or two, it's just another dead end
For a minute or two, I'll get you off my mind
But you keep comin' back to me every time
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on a plane and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you
I bury myself in my job all day
Just tryin' to get lost in the usual ways
Smilin' and laughin' and jokin' around with the guys
Gotta do something to deaden the pain
So I stare at the window just watchin' the rain
But all I can see in the haze is the grey of your eyes
So what do I do with all the pieces of you in me
If you're never comin' back, set me free
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on plane, and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said, and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you
Where do I go from you
Where do I go to get over the fact

Way down in Louisiana where the moss and cypress grew
You'd find old Jack in a shotgun shack
In the back of the black bayou
Some folks called him crazy but I knew better than that
He kept a hundred dollar bill tucked away in the brim
Of his dirty old cowboy hat
Jack told me a story when I was ten years
He said there was once a fool tried to swim this swamp
With his back weighted down with gold
He said you should've seen that alligator smile
He had a meal fit for a king
But he need up on my table son, money ain't everything
He said there's only one way into this world
And one way out it's true
You either eat the alligator
Or he's gonna eat you
There's people livin' in a high-rise
That'll never hear a robin sing
What good is first place when you're in a rat race
Money ain't everything
Little Maggie May lay dying, her heart was about to go
When her daddy found a sack on the porch out back
With a half a million dollars in gold
They still talk about the stranger who saved her life that spring
No name on the note but someone wrote, money ain't everything
He said there's only one way into this world

Cover story told about another heartbroke beauty queen
How she was gettin' over just one more sad affair

That ordinary people have extraordinary love
A million little miracles far beneath the stars above
The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me
Is a life as ordinary as can be
Then I heard some famous people had an anniversary
Five long years together; it was Hollywood history
Now my grandma and grandpa never made no printed page
But they took the love of fifty-seven years right to the grave
'Cause ordinary people have extraordinary love
A million little miracles far beneath the stars above
The greatest gift that I could ever wish for you and me
Is a life as ordinary as can be
Now, we all like to watch, and by the time the movie ends
Who of us hasn't wished to be a little more like them?
But I bet every time two stars are breaking up
That they wish somehow, someway they were a little more like us
'Cause ordinary people have extraordinary love

And leave that little girl behind
I can't believe how heavy she's laying on my mind
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad
I'm hoping that the tequila is gonna take me back
Give me the salt and the lime
So I can taste her and hold her one last time
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need her bad
Those eyes and that smile they drove me while, I just couldn't resist
I couldn't get enough from our first touch to our last kiss
I never understood a single word she said
Oh but she left no doubt
When she spoke to me in the language of love
She turned my world inside out
Oh tonight I need a Margarita and I need it bad

If you're gonna ride you gotta learn to fall
But where do I fit in the picture
Or do I really fit at all
Or have I become a fixture
On an old forgotten wall
Well it looks like I finally made the front page
You know you always said I would
And things are well here in room twenty eight
God I hope you're doing good
There's a picture in my wallet
That I look at sometimes
It sends chills through my bones

Worryin' about stocks and bonds
He's up and he's down and he only smiles
When the market's strong
I spend my whole week's wages
At the dance on Saturday night
I won't never grow a portfolio
But hey that's alright

I got a cabin in the country
And the tin roof rattles
When the rain comes down
Where the wind through the pine
Helps me unwind
While the world goes 'round
I got a woman that fills my heart so full
That it overflows
And how it gets any better than this
Brother I don't know

Me and Bobby watched the clock all afternoon
Waitin' for the bell and Mrs. Greer

That night I couldn't sleep 'cause the very next day
They started up the summertime matinees
With a different movie every afternoon
At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Me and Bobby rode rockets into outer space
We drove Daytona and we won the race
We shot a lotta bull and some bad guys too
At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two

Well, the years went by and the price went up
From a couple of quarters to a couple of bucks
Bobby and his family moved away
So I found my little girl to take his place
Me and Betty saw our share of love scenes
We even saw a couple on the movie screen
John Wayne won the lady and I did too
At the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
The Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Now the Melrose Avenue Cinema Two
Is a second hand store called 'Nothin' New'
All that's left of the old marquee
Is some broken glass and one crooked 'T'
And I watch old movies on a new TV

We still hold hands like we used to do

How many times
I've reached for you
Every night
I'd drift off to sleep
And there you would be
Reaching for me too
Oh but now
I don't have to close my eyes
For this dream to come alive
It's real
It's here in my heart
Stronger than steel
Brighter than a million stars
Baby you, have shown me
How love should feel
Every single touch
Tells me that this love is real
I guess, I really thought
The thrill would wear off
Eventually
Oh but still
I can't get enough
I still get a rush
When you're close to me
You're the fire
Burning in my soul
And that is how I know
It's real
It's here in my heart
Stronger than steel
Brighter than a million stars
Baby you, have shown me
How love should feel
Every single touch
Tells me that this love is real
I can't remember
Ever feeling like this
With every look and every kiss
It's real
Baby you, have shown me
How love should feel
Every single touch
Tells me that this love
Every single touch
Tell me that this love is real"

You and me and Mother Goose
Learning lines to nursery rhymes
That's when I fell in love with you
Back when it was
One, two, buckle my show
Three, four, shut the door
Five, Six, pick up sticks
Even then my heart was yours
College days, miles apart
So afraid you'd forget
Writing letters every day
And evading every one like this
One, two, I miss you
Three, four, I walk the floor
Five, six, come back quick
I don't wanna miss you no more
A little girl, a little boy
Playing on a swing in the yard
As we watch, I hold your hand
You're still holding onto my heart
And now it's
One, two, I love you
Three, four, let's have one more
Five, six, I wouldn't miss
A day of this for all the treasure
On the ocean floor
One, two, I love you

Every time you walk in the room
I find myself reaching for you

Never at a loss for words

The moon was shing on your face
You looked like a picture sittin' there
And time stood still there in that place
The water was singin', out hearts were beatin' fast
Two high school lovers thinkin' it would always last
Down by the riverside on a warm summer night
We gave into passion for the very first time
We fumbled with love 'til we got it right
And we found heaven down by the riverside
Now you're nothin' but a ghost
That still haunts my memory
And you're always waitin' there
When I go walkin' through my dreams
There's no happy ending but I know our love will last
'Cause when I close my eyes you always take me back
Down by the riverside on a warm summer night
We gave into passion for the very first time

A beautiful woman with every reason to know it

A country boy and city girl makin' life in this old world
We went against the grain and against all odds

I'd say that's right?
I'd say that's right on the money
Sure as the summer in Florida's sunny
I'd say that's right down the middle
Ain't no doubt, not even a little
Will I love you for the rest of my life

And drinking beer on a Friday night

But give two kids all that room
And there's no tellin' what they'd find

Beneath the stars in each other's arms

Is everyone's lookin' for a way out
But that never crossed their minds at all
After twenty good years there's no doubt
The two of them saw so much more
Than corn and barbed wire fence
They found a love worth stayin' for
And they've been together ever since

If you dont open up, I may never know
What if we dont say whats on our minds and we walk away
We might live out our lives and never feel this way
What if I am the one and you are the one, what if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice
Oh girl, what if you are the one and I am the one
What if tonight is the night
What if once in a lifetime love dont come twice"

Laughin' at all my best friends jokes
Things I loved when I was a kid
Muddy roads, muddy feet
I didn't live on no blacktop street
Things have changed a lot but I never did
And I don't want to think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just want to live until I die
Livin' right, livin' in this little old town I grew up in
But I still held on to my dreams
Standin' proud, standin' tall
Standin' smack dab in the middle of it all
I don't worry 'bout things that I can't change
And I don't want to think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just want to live until I die
And everything around me are
Things I dearly love
And every night I get on my knees and thank
The lord above
And I don't want to think about tomorrow
I don't need anything money can buy
I don't have to beg, steal, or borrow
I just want to live until I die

Talk to me baby, tell me what you're feeling.

Are you ready to take that ride?

Those hands of time start to healing
You're here at my door
Saying your new dreams
Have led you back to me
Where were you
When I was going crazy
Where were you
Did you know what your leavin'?
Put me through
You were feeling lost, last thing I knew
You went off to find yourself
Where were you

Or act like I don't care
But I won't betray my heart
Now that we've come this far

One on her back
And I ain't saying
Where the other one's at

But she's a beauty queen
Taking glamour shots
In cut-off jeans

In his beat-up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Til he said 'I'm here to help you, ma'm
By the way, my name's Joe.'
She said 'I'm from St. Louis
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you.'
When he changed the tire
And closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said 'How much do I owe you?'
Here's what he had to say
'You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.'
Well, a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
She must have been eight months
Along and dead on her feet
No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her
Change from a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a nakpin left a note
There were tears in the waitress' eyes
When she read what she wrote
'You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
Someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do
Don't let the chain of love end with you.'
That night when she got
Home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking about the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low
'Everything's gonna be alright
I love you, Joe.'"

If you're never comin' back, set me free
Where do I go to get over the fact
That you got on plane, and you ain't comin' back
I said what I said, and you did what you had to do
Where does a man have to go to get over the truth
Where do I go from you

Them milk shakes must be good, 'cause I just can't get my fill
Since the first time she made me one I've been head over heels

""Hello,my name is Alice""
I'll be doggone if she ain't the prettiest thing

Her blue eyes they shine brighter
Than the Aurora Borealis
She looks like a queen
Workin' in that white palace

I get one thing at a time so I can make another pass
I bet I'm the only one who ever gives her a tip

And she said: ""You're alive""
Part IV: Depression
Is this my dream? Is this my life?
Is this my truth? Is this my lie?
So many thoughts, consuming me...
There's a cold here in my heart, bleeding me out. Bleeding me.
There's a cold here in my room. On the bed sheets on the floor.
I got the gun. I reload...
Op - 911 Bozeman County, what is the address of the emergency?
Caller - I... It's 100 Johnstone street, apartment 419.
Op - What is the emergency?
Caller - I... I just Heard a gunshot in the apartment next door.
The apartment where the shot was fired is number 421.
Op - Ok, I need you to stay in your apartment, police are on their way. Can you tell me the color of the building you're in?
Caller - It's... Em... A White building with a glass door.
Op - Ok, I need you to stay with me on the phone until the police arrive. Do you know the name of the person...do you know the person that lives in there?
Caller - No. I've just seen him a few times. The last time I saw him he was acting weird. His wife had just died, you know?
Part V: Acceptance
And when the endless night comes.
Will I still know that I lived? That I did everything I could to survive?
That I lived each second as if it was the last?"

The door isn't closed anymore, step through.
It's not the chains, he pours himself in this place.
He can't move, his legs won't work he cannot feel.
He has never felt this way before
Six feet under in this shallow grave he dug.
He thinks: am I just another lying face?
Sometimes it seems he betrays himself.
He wonders if after farewell there is hope.
Remembrance will cast the shadow of his doom.
For any sign of light: run...
He has walked this trail for miles thinking.
He has known this would be his conviction
Slave to his own name so far.
Now it's time to change.
Broken he sits, burned by a thousand fires.
He knows it hurts... time to put the pieces back together."
362131,axis,2016,asimastrica,Other,"If there was a day... If there was a day...
When the earth stood perfectly still.
The axis of symmetry is breaking and I'm falling, I'm falling with it.
Truth: resonance in mind.
I seek the sympathy in my soul.
Letting the words come to life
I won't let truth stay hidden and untold.
I will dream of hope even if I walk alone.
For that day will come.
Holding the pieces from within, not to fall again.
I lost all confidence.
And if we could fly above the sun in soul and mind.
We wouldn't mind falling down.
Eradicate indifference."

with a fist in the air I march on
For the hunter is hunted its sword has been blunted
by echoes of hunger in song
It's blinded by lust from an ultimate plain
in a castle that lives in the sky
My mission at hand is to murder its plan
and bring down the all Seeing Eye
Together we stand in a fight for the right
to be free from the lies and deceit
Our brains have been washed and our souls have been lost yet we will not back down or retreat
They will not give up it is obvious
so we will unite with our consciousness
And eventually were going to repossess
the freedoms we had while we clean the mess
Now as I stare into space I can see the stress
on the physical plane of our consciousness
The things that we want we can manifest
all we need is to focus
In the land of dreams it's an endless sea
where the conscious breathe for eternity
We can all unite there collectively
but we need is to believe its easy
Cos there are too many minds that are waking up
and there are too many lies in the media
And now the youth of our culture is shaping up
to be the spiritual army who will fight ya
But if we believe the world is gonna end
then we can make it happen so don't pretend
That it's not up to you
and you've got no control
the power lives within your soul
Gaze at the Earth from a Distance
Can't you see that we are one it's obvious
Gaze at the Earth from a Distance
We can all unite with our consciousness
Suspended in time in this universe
Gaze at the Earth from a distance
We can all unite
We can all unite"

As I'm tappin' away upon my key pad
We've had too many cups but not enough tea bags
We sad
That it's all about the me nag
All wiped up with a cheap rag
Glee's bad
She's mad about the games in her mind
The things she will say and the things she will find
Will keep pressing play and keep pressing rewind
Stuck in a loop may grind, yo but it's fine
Cos it's a new day in the city
A welcoming committee
For the pretty and the gritty
Here kitty looking so witty
Come and get heavy and come and look silly
We all in a zoo we are domesticated
Just like ya fruit but more complicated
Kinda overrated, underestimated
Interrelated now the loves translated
The sky is forever
I feel the press on my chest from all the stress that I'm getting
The chatter and clatter is getting fatter by the second
We boast the most as we approach Armageddon
The city's a pity of the infinity we getting
So I zoom out and I fall into a dream
My shadow shouts as my eyes begin to scream
But I just let go, no need to intervene
The mudders of colours combobulating into a dream
Now I, find my self upon a whole new level
Solid is a sound and a liquid is the treble
My mind is the truth and my body is the vessel
I'm totally at one no need to be a rebel
I just lay back and shut my eyes
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Let me fly, into your mind and improvise
So I can ride upon a melody and harmonise"

So take a deep breath, you got to release stress
Life is not a beep test running is a weakness
And you can't hide in that smoke that you blaze
It shines a light upon your negative ways
Wake up wake you been missing all the fun
We been dancing and laughing connecting each and everyone
Inspiration from the sun, the bass and the drum
The strings that we strum has only just begun
You need to slow down let me give you this low down

You know your own mind
You know what feels right
Leave a marker on this life
Open heart, open mind
Life's to short don't waste it (listen)
Don't run, stand and face it. (Watch out)
Don't let them trouble you trouble
Cause if they ever bring you down
They will struggle to struggle
Strip you bare and steal your crown

They bring you lies on a plate then refuse

I walk alone on this road to Babylon
I play the reggaeton and I burn a spliff alone
I feel a fire that's higher than Gibbon
I wanna get deep like the lake of Balaton
So get down low if you wanna get it on
And bounce like so yes and move it all around
Now jump up high if you wanna carry on
Put your hands to the sky, yes we're gonna jump around
Now move to the sound of your loud stereo
We're gonna go around just like a merry go
Now buckle up tight everybody here we go
You might get a fright and loose your ego, ey
You wanna know what you all already know
You just don't know that you have it in your soul
Now make your soul glow just like a UFO
And get down deep to feel your inner flow, ey

I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
Yeah yeah, alright
[Verse 2]
I'm taking the time to produce my devotion
Feel the power of my flame and reuse my emotion
Like an ocean of a vein from the rush of an explosion
I'm a trap to my brain, conceded by my notion
Pressurize my eyes so I can see the greater picture
Realise my size and see the truth about my stricture
Let the truth arise in the form of literature
So no lies inside deteriorate my signature
I'm a treacherous mind to my body that is lost
A frozen dangerous rhyme my consciousness has turned to frost
I've lost my sense of time yet my history is embossed
In my mind so I'll find a goal at any cost, now
Take back the agony that's in front of me
Or let it be and forever see it as a positivity
You're free to be what you wanna be
But realistically it's all a dream, it's all a dream yeah

It's all a dream
It's all a dream
It's all a dream

Cathedrals lyrics
When cathedrals, they sink into the sea
And the sand
The goals that are left often
They slip through the hand
When the world it's in your hand
And the old man is dead
Then our love, very hard
At the park, sin of that day in my life
When the bolts of the desert
They turn to supply,
Beware of the emptiness
It plays with the mind
When the ...said
And the old man is dead
When all of, very hard
At the park, sin of that day
In my heart."

Who looks like a ghost
Upon the money most

Oh the soulless dance
upon the English dew
Across the green fields
a procession grows
We are the out-of-time
people of the rose, sing
We are the out-of-time
people of the rose
The nightingale rejoices
The hour disapproves
The morning unrequited
The moon my heart did choose
Now the dancing king is the sun."

Packing more punch than a Mississippi fist fight
Oh oh my my
Walked my way, took my hand, said ""Let's go""
Had more game than the Mandalay Casino
Thought I hit the jackpot, I was on a good roll
Showed you what I know
Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true
Before I knew it my heartstrings unwound
I fell faster than a cannonball straight down
Everybody talking all over this now:
""Look there he goes again""
Lie lie lied like a politician
Shoulda read the headlines, paid more attention
To my suspicions, my intuition
I shoulda listened
Too good to be true
Like diamonds on the soles of my shoes
Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled
He ain't nothing but too good to be real
Don't believe the way he's making you feel
He'll break your pretty little heart in two
Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true
I shoulda seen it from a mile away
I should have called a spade a spade
I shoulda known that you're
Too good to be true

Like money falling out of the blue
Don't be fooled

Don't believe the way he's making you feel

Momma told me about boys like you
Too good to be true
Too good to be true
You're just too good to be (too good to be)
You're just too good to be (too good to be)
You're just too good to be true

Shoulda stopped for gas ten miles ago
Back in Prairie Grove
And now we're stuck and just our luck
And it's too hot to say, ""I told you so""
But I told you so
As I recall, my Uncle Paul
Talked about a swimming hole not far from here
There's no iced tea, no A-C
I guess we'll just have to cool off naturally
Close your eyes, uh-uh, no peekin'
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
Wanna go oh oh oh oh?
Sweet temptation in the cool blue water
Probably shouldn't but I think we oughta
Go oh oh oh oh oh oh
It ain't no thing
Pretty sure it ain't no sin
Let's go skinny dippin'
You're a boy and I'm a girl
But I ain't scared to give it a whirl
If you're not
We can hang our clothes on a big oak tree
Let's just hope nobody sees
But if they do, so what
You say one, I'll say two
Right on three, just me and you in our birthday suits
Close your eyes, uh-uh, no peekin'
Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'
Wanna go oh oh oh oh?
Sweet temptation in the cool blue water
Probably shouldn't but I think we oughta
Go oh oh oh oh oh oh
It ain't no thing
Pretty sure it ain't no sin
Let's go skinny dippin'
Birds and bees and frogs are free
You should come along with me

Sweet temptation in the cool blue water
Probably shouldn't but I think we oughta

From the little girl you taught to fly
To the sun
To Misses Thorton, from third grade
I remember all the times you stayed
Till Daddy picked me up
Oh, did you ever know?
Did I ever tell you so?
Oh I hope you understand
You have so much to do with who I am
To my older brother, Wes
I worshiped everything you did and said
I hope it didn't bother you
To Grandma Melva and Grandpa Lin,
What I'd give just to be five again
Singin' in your living room
Oh, did you ever know?
Did I ever tell you so?
Oh, I hope you understand
You have so much to do with who I am
To Arkansas summer wind,
To feelings that never end
To anyone who called me friend
All the blessings from above
To Mama's kiss and Daddy's hugs
I didn't say it near enough
Thank you for who I am

It might not make sense
But that's just the way it feels to me
I'm as bad as an old washing machine
Spinning 'round but I never get clean
Don't you see
'Cause baby, you're gone but you're like the wind
Out of the calm you come back again
Rattling the windows of my painted shut heart
Feels so real
Inside I still got this breaking in my chest
Don't feel like flesh, it feels like glass
And glass shatters
Oh, outside I'm not leather yet
But these days I'm tougher than I ever thought I'd get
Or ever wanna be and the heart of the matter
Is baby, you're gone but you're like the wind
Out of the calm you come back again
Rattling the windows of my painted shut heart, oh
Feels so real, feels so real
Pulling down Jupiter would be much easier
Swimming in the sky, that would be a breeze
The finding a magic cure, help me remember
You're nothing but a memory, yeah
Baby, you're gone but you're like the wind
Out of the calm you come back again
Rattling the windows of my painted shut heart
Feels so real, feels so real
It was two years ago and it was yesterday

You've got your sexy way of talking,
I let you get all under my skin,
But now your welcome has worn off and
So next time you go, don't come back again,
Cause your train don't stop here anymore,
I ain't your gas-up rest stop, swinging door,
You can't just walk in,
Walk out like so many times before,
I ain't your swinging door,
You've got a girl in every cow-town,
You think I don't know how you cat around,
I let your sweet talk get my guard down,
Took me a while to figure you out,
But I've got you figured all out now,
And your train don't stop here anymore,
I ain't your gas-up rest stop, swinging door,
You can't just walk in,
Walk out like so many time before,
I ain't your swinging door,
You'd best make up your mind,
Cause if you go you ain't coming back this time,
Your train don't stop here anymore,
I ain't your quick stop, walk up, open 24
You can't just walk in, walk out,
Treat me like your candy store,
Your train don't stop here anymore,
I ain't your gas-up rest stop, swinging door,

Boy, after only just a couple of dates
You're hands down, outright blowing my mind
In nearly every single way
You're amazing and yet
There's only so much I can get
From picnics, long walks, flowers and talks
Baby here's what I suggest
It's time I see ya belly-up to a bar
How 'bout ya show me what kind of cowboy you are?
Are you a Kenny tequila, Buffet margarita
Or an Alan Jackson hurricane?
Are you a good time, flask of moonshine
Going George Strait to my brain?
A girl can tell a lot about a boy in one shot
I gotta know you've got a Bocephus side
So what's in the cup, order it up
Who am I drinking tonight?
You might not have guessed
Judging by my heels and lacy dress
I'm a wide-neck Gretchen, Loretta Lynn
I've learned from the best
Women like that know how to throw a few back
We gotta have a man who can keep up with all that
Are you a Kenny tequila, Buffet margarita
Or an Alan Jackson hurricane?
Are you a good time, flask of moonshine
Going George Strait to my brain?
A girl can tell a lot about a boy in one shot
I gotta know you've got a Bocephus side
So what's in the cup, order it up
Who am I drinking tonight?
Oh yeah
So pick your poison and make it two
What kinda trouble are we gettin' into?
Are you a Kenny tequila, Buffet margarita
Or an Alan Jackson hurricane?
Are you a good time, flask of moonshine
Going George Strait to my brain?

Best actress in a show

Little do you know
I'm a liar
I'm a liar, the biggest liar in the world
I'm crying
I'm crying like I've never cried before
I know you always heard me say
You'll meet the perfect girl one day
The night you called and told me the news
I said I couldn't be more thrilled for you
This might be funny timing
Probably doesn't matter now
I never thought I'd say this but I just figured out
I'm a liar
I'm a liar, the biggest liar in the world
I'm crying
I'm crying like I've never cried before
If I ever tell you that I've found the perfect man
That he's everything I've ever wanted just as I had planned

Looks a lot like me and you
She's looking out at the window
He's staring down at his shoes
She gets another glass of Cabernet
She's searching hard for something to say
He's got that little too late look on his already gone face
Look through each other like a piece of glass
Is that what happens when the years fly past?
Lately I've been feeling like that
Is it time for a coming to Jesus
Baby tell me that won't be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?
Could it be our last supper?
Tell me you're uncomfortably numb
I can't imagine I'm the only one
Is goodbye on the tip of your tongue
Any love left, gotta be some
Why'd you bring me to my favorite place?
A little wine and everything's OK
Are we really gonna end this way?
Is it time for a coming to Jesus
Baby tell me that won't be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?
Could it be our last supper?
You break the bread and you break my heart
You raise the glass as we fall apart
Guess it's time for a coming to Jesus
Looks like that just might be us, us
Is that all we are to each other?

And I'm measured up by depth and girth
The Father says now what's he worth
May he see Jesus death and birth
Don't measure me by dollar signs
Or bricks and mortar you may find
By Christ alone will I be found
Worthy of that golden crown
Worthy of that golden crown
The value of this life I've lived
How did I love, did I forgive
Where did my treasure truly lay
How did I start and end each day
Don't measure me by battles won
Or some good deed that I have done
By Christ alone will I be found
Worthy of that golden crown
Worthy of that golden crown
May be a pauper or a king
Have nothing or have everything
The question begs, do you belong
Do you sing a resurrection song
Measured by the master's hand
On only one truth can we stand
By Christ alone will we be found
Worthy of that golden crown
Worthy of that golden crown"
